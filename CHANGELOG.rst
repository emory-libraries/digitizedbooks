   to ensure enduring access and discoverability of that file.

   information about the user and the items they have uploaded so they can
   view and download those items.
 * An authenticated user is redirected to their profile, which includes a link
   for ingesting content to give them a personalized jumping-off "home"
   point for other functionality.

   have previously ingested to better identify it and to improve
   discoverability.
