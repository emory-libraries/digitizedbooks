THERE there are two distinct branches of the Negro problem, viz.,
the rustic and the urban. The problem of the country Negro may
be deferred, that of his urban brother is immediate and imperative.
While the former may be preserved indefinitely, as it were in a state
of nature, the latter demands immediate rescue from destruction.
The influx of rural population into large centers constitutes one
of the most serious sociological movements of the last half century.
The evils which flow in the train of this movement have been univer¬
sally noted and marked upon. Such evils fall most heavily upon the
poor Negroes, who are allured to the destruction of city life as moths by
the glare of the candle. These unfortunate people rush from the
country where they have a useful status and function, to the city where
there is no industrial raison d'etre for them, and inevitably they sink to
the bottom of the social scale, where they form the dregs, the scum, and
menace of municipal life. A counter stream of tendency which will
return this element to the place where it may become a helpful con¬
tributing factor is a sociological desideratum devoutly to be wished.
Nowhere is the evil of crowding into cities more noticeable than at
the capital of the nation. Every social or political disturbance in the
South is sure to bring afresh wave of Negro immigrants into this city,
as the first stopping place on their way to the North. The feeblest,
and most helpless,find themselves stranded and unable to proceed further,
and settle down as a part of the dark and nether life of the national capi¬
tal. The Negro population of Washington is divided into two sharply de¬
fined classes, the upper ten and the lower ninety. The government
clerks, school teachers, professional and business men, with their fami¬
lies and their connections constitute a class of considerable wealth and
culture, who cultivate the social graces and refined amenities of life.
But it is distressing to contemplate how the other half, or rather the
other nine-tenths, lives. There are no productive industries in the Dis¬
trict of Columbia. The condition of these people is as pitiable and de¬
plorable as can well be imagined. They are forced to live in the dens
and alleys where they eke out a miserable and precarious existence.
It can be easily seen that these conditions must bear most hardly
upon that element of the population, between the ages of ten and
eighteen, who are just old enough to forfeit parental solicitude and care,
and yet not sufficiently mature to maintain the struggle for themselves.
There is a large class of such children thrown upon the public chari¬
ties of the community.
