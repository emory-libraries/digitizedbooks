teachers are well equipped, courses of instruction are identical in kind
and extent with those intended for Caucasian children, and the system
is justly far-famed for its thoroughness and excellence. And yet its
wholesome influence upon the class with which this article deals is
scarcely at all discernible. Educational plans and methods must be
devised,modified and adapted so as to reach the humblest of these and
lift them to higher standards and nobler modes of life. This is the
great educational need of the city Negro.
In all discussions of this problem, we are referred to Hampton and
Tuskegee, as if they were adequate to cover the entire field. These
institutions, noble as they are within their circle and scope, do not and
can not touch this aspect of the problem. Such movements as the
Hart Farm School will do for the urban Negro what these two great
institutions are calculated to do for his rural brother.
According to the census of 1900, there were seventy-two cities in
the United States with a Negro population of five thousand and up¬
ward, averaging seventeen thousand each, aggregating eight hundred
thousand in all. Here will be found tens of thousands of dependent
and neglected children who fall outside of the pale of established ed¬
ucational and moral influences. The agency which reaches and saves
this class will relieve that phase of the situation which is as acute and
imperative as any other.
The question naturally arises as to the basis of support of the Hart
Farm School. The Board of Children's Guardians pays for the main¬
tenance and subsistence of a stipulated number of boys, but does not
contribute towards the development of the institution. Comparison
shows that the per capita allowance for this work falls short of that
allotted to punitive and corrective institutions. A few hundred dol¬
lars, donated by private philanthropy, have been used for the mainten¬
ance of boys other than wards of the Board of Children's Guardians.
The balance has been contributed by Mr. Hart himself, absorbing the
entire accumulation of his life's work.
In the conception and execution of this work Mr. Hart has not
only proved himself to be an educator of rare sagacity, but a philan¬
thropist as well. For it is the spirit of true philanthropy which strives
to reach and to save even unto the uttermost.
