Methodist Episcopal Church as set forth in the laws made by thi body,
the delegates of this General Conference, representing the great African
Methodist connection, are primarily responsible for the maintenance of
Wilberforce University; educationally speaking, and as the term is
used by the public at large as well as is absolutely required by the
organic school life of Wilberforce University, the term, "Wilberforce
University" includes the old Wilberforce foundation and all of the
departments to which she has given birth. Technically Wilberforce
University is a simple affair; educationally it is a complex institution
with inter-dependent parts and a great many intricacies requiring
wisdom, patience and breadth of administration. The inclusive Wil¬
berforce University has as its component parts the College of Liberal
Arts, the Combined Normal and Industrial Department, and Payne
Theological Seminary of Wilberforce University. The College of
Liberal Arts and Payne Theological Seminary being exclusively the
property of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, must be
supported by that church. The Combined Normal and Industrial
Department of Wilberforce University is being lavishly supported by
the State of Ohio. The General Assembly of Ohio, just adjourned,
appropriated to this department forty thousand dollars under a general
levy and ninety thousand dollars as a fund for special improvements
and extensive developments. Your humble servants a Wilberforce
University take off their hats in recognition of the generosity of the
great State of Ohio and yield up to her inexpressible thanks, but we
urn with pleading hands to the great African Methodist Episcopal
Connection, with her three-quarters of a million members, thirteen
Bishops, Presiding Elders, Travelling Preachers, Local Preachers,
Exhorters, Sunday School Superintendents and Teachers which no
man can number, and ask with great anxiety: What will you do for
the maintenance, perpetuity and enlargement of Great Old Wilber¬
force, the mother institution of African Methodism., the greatest single
good in the hands of the Negroes of the world ? Will the three hun¬
dred and fifty Connectional Trustees of Wilberforce University go into
counsel here and now and provide largely for the support of Wilber¬
force University? Or will we adorn ourselves with the title of trustee¬
ship and forget the great trust imposed upon us? I pray the Confer¬
ence not to adjourn until it has made respectable provisions for the
maintenance of Wilberforce University and Payne Theological Semi-
