relation of Professor of Mathematics. We greatly miss him at the
University as a co-laborer and counsellor, for he was all of this in an
unstinted way. He died where manhood's fruitful morning had
barely reached noon, surrounded by tender wife, weeping children
and loving friends; but full of faith and hope in the God whom he
had served faithfully and long. He was elected president of Wilber-
force University in the year 1884 and filled the office with credit and
distinction until June, 1900, a period of sixteen years; longer by
three years than any other incumbent. We miss him. We are confi¬
dent, however, that we shall meet him in the bosom of Abraham,
where we believe he has met loved ones. Bishop Moore, one of the
chief pastors of the Church and for many years one of the trustees of
the University has also passed away. In him Wilberforce has lost a
friend. Rev. Phillip Hubbard, Financial Secretary of the A. M. E.
Church, was also a trustee of the University who spared neither purse
nor voice in assisting the University. Among the last testimonials
of his love for the University was the placing of an order with a firm
in Europe for the construction of a telescope for University Astrono¬
mical Observations. To our great regret he died before he could
consummate this purpose. It seems like a great pity for the friends
of this good man to allow this cherished hope of his to fade away and
die. Phillip Hubbard though asleep should yet speak to us through
this fitting monument to his memory. As we ga^e up in the starry
galaxy while they look down upon us at Wiberforce, Phillip Hubbard
should be remembered. It is our hope and prophesy that there will
be found in our great church sufficient love for this good man to re¬
sult in perpetuating his memory by carrying out this cherished pur¬
pose. Other trustees who have rendered great service to the Uni¬
versity have also passed away and are numbered among our sainted
dead.
As a result of the development of the University during the past
forty years, the term, "Wilberforce University," has a double mean
ing. Technically speaking, it means the various departments of edu¬
cational work carried on under the immediate jurisdiction of the trus¬
tees of Wilberforce University as founded and incorporated by
Daniel A. Payne and his coadjutors under the auspices of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church and at their immediate expense; these
trustees being creatures of the General Conference of the African
