Report of the President.
To the Bishops and Members of the Twenty-Second Quadrennial
Session, General Conference of the A. M. E. Church, now Con¬

contagions, although at times threatened by them. In spite of small
injuries that have come to us by fire and sickness, infinite goodness
has everywhere marked these four passing years.
Since we met in Columbus, Ex-President Mitchell, my lamented
