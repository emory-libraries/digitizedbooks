praise and too much rejoicing on account of this great gift cannot be
endulged in by the lovers of Wilberforce Univarsity.
Through a personal visit of the President of Wilberforce Univer¬
sity to Parsons, Kansas, the University is now in possession of some
valuable real estate, in that city, bequeated many years ago by Mrs.
Lucy Cooper of sainted memory.
Chaplain T. G. Steward, for some years a resident of Wilberforce
and whose good wife was resident Physician of Wilberforce University,
has memorialized his son Walter Hall Steward, a graduate of Wilber¬
force University, by giving One-thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) as a
nucleus, to which he will add from time to time, for the erection of a
Walter Hall Steward Memorial Building on the University grounds.
For this purpose I stand pledged to raise funds. All of the Endow¬
ments and other properties owned by the University at the close of the
last Quadrennium are sacredly in tact, none having been used for
current expenses and at the same time some of the old debts have
been paid.
Some very forward movements at the University, which are full
of blessings proximate and remote, are in process at the University.
These will be brought before the coming Trustee Board and therefore
are not mentioned here.
It is my belief that the University is entering upon a new era of
Success and usefulness. Much, however, will depend upon the legis¬
lation of this body looking to the maintenance of the College and
Theological Departments. Under cover with this report will appear
the University financial report by the Secretary and Treasurer of the
University and elsewhere will appear the report of the Dean of the
Theological Department and hence they are not made here.
Respectfully,
Joshua H. Jones,
President, Wilberforce University.
