fiary. It was the purpose of the General Conference and the founders
of the University to make the school ^s great and as broad as is our
growing connection and to have all the Conferences to contribute to
its support. It was for this reason that each Annual Conference was
given equal representation on the trustee board.
Our policy at Wilberforce University is to so develop the various
departments and departmental properties as to make them as efficient
as possible and to co ordinate these departments, into one all-inclusive
Wilberforce forming a working whole in which each part will help
every other part of the University, and all work together for the
accomplishment of one great end, viz: the development of the Negro
intellectually, morally, industrially and politically, so that he may pro¬
mote most rapidly his own well-being along with that of the public
welfare.
The worth of any school is determined by what it does for its
students and by what it does through them for society. Measured by
this standard, the Church has a right to exercise becoming pride in
Wilberforce University. When we think of the accomplishments of
Bishop Lee, President S. T. Mitchell, President T. H. Jackson of
Shorter College, President I. M. Burgan of Paul Quinn College,
Doctors Jenifer, Hearst and Beckett, Chaplains Prielieu, Anderson
and Arnett, Secretary Horace Talbert of Wilberforce University,
Superintendent J. P. Shorter of the Combined Normal and Industrial
Department of Wilberforce University, Professors E. A. Clarke, J.
Wheeler, Masterson, J. A. Kirk, J. A. Crawford, J. Gibson, T. D.
Scott, Earl Finch, Julius Dodson, Rush Morris and J. D. Lowery,
Miss Hallie Quinn Brown. Miss H. Georgiana White, Mrs. Carey, the
Poet Whitman and Mrs. Mixon, and many others that might be named
together with the vast army of undergraduates and honorary alumni
who have stirred this country from ocean to ocean, why should we
not take delight in Wilberforce University? Not only are the older
graduates doing the University honor where they go, illustrating abun¬
dantly what the University has done for them and society, but our
later day graduates among whom are John Coleman, teacher at Gal¬
veston, Texas, Charlotte Manye, teacher at Dwaars River, South
Africa, Gustavus Stewart, teacher at St. Joseph, Missouri, Florence
Thomas, teacher at Porto Rico, class of 1901.
