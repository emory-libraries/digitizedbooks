PREFACE.
This little book is written for the specific pur¬
pose of setting before busy men, in the simplest
and shortest way, the character, works, times and
mission of the Minor Prophet whose name it
bears. It is not exhaustive nor excursive, but
essays to give in outline and essence what has
been said in many large, volumes. Still, one will
be greatly mistaken who takes it for a mere com¬
pilation. It is an independent and original pre¬
sentation of the author's views and reflections
based upon standard history as given by the best
authorities.
It is written, first of all, for studious men who
are denied the advantages of school training and
who are unable to purchase the large and expen¬
sive books treating upon these subjects. The
young minister in a small charge or country cir¬
cuit, even if his education be limited, can easily
read and understand, and feel that he has the
essential things often so much more stiltedly and
technically set down in volumes of portentous
size. He can, because of its convenient size and
small weight, carry this book in his pocket to
use in filling out a long wait for breakfast, or the
time taken on a street car ride; and having read
it, he may test his mastery of the contents by
quizzing himself from the questions in the back
of the book, which have been carefully framed to
cover the whole subject.
This volume is one of a series uniform in
treatment, and any person who finishes the series
(to be issued by installments) will be excellently
