mulated those plans which had made Israel
a great name among the nations of the earth.
It was there that the great Solomon had
startled the world by his great and astound¬
ing wisdom. There the good King Heze-
kiah had done that which was "right in tbe
sight of the Lord/' and had "walked in the
footsteps of his fathers."
It was true that the great prophet Isaiah
had said of this Holy City: "Woe to Ariel,
to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add
ye year to year: let them kill sacrifices. Yet
I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heavi-
iess and sorrow; and it shall be unio me as
unto Ariel. And I will camp against thee
round about, and zvill lay si>g? against thee
with a mount, and I will raise forts against
thee" (Isaiah xxix:i, 2, 3).
It was true that every word of this dismal
prophecy was literally fulfilled; but it was
also true that the same prophet had encour¬
aged Israel to look forward to the passing
away of these dreadful times in words full
of comfort and encouragement: "Comfort
ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
Speak comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry
unto her, that her warfare is accomplished,
that her iniquity is pardoned; for she hath
received of the Lord's hand double for all
her sins" (Isaiah xl:i, 2).
