18 LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF ZECHARIAH.
Judah, Israel and Jerusalem, And the Lord
showed me four carpenters. Then said I,
What came these to dof And he spake, say¬
ing, These are the horns which have scat¬
tered Judah, so that no man did lift up his
head: but these are come to fray them, to
cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which
lifted up their horn over the land of Judah
to scatter it."
Had not Judah been scattered when the
great armies of the Persians marched over
its hills and valleys, laying waste its cities
and towns?
Had not "horns" pierced the heart of the
nation when the rude hands of the Gentile
invaders were directed against that one ob¬
ject, dearest to the heart of the Jewish peo¬
ple,—the Temple?
Surely no other people of which history
gives any account had been so effectually
scattered.
But the same power that permitted the
scattering will bring the remnants together
again, and make of them one harmonious
whole for the glory of His name.
If the people needed encouragement,
Zechariah supplied that need.
