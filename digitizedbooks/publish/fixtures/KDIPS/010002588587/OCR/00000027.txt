2 2 LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF ZECHARIAH.
is intended to arouse the enthusiasm of the
people and to strengthen their faith in the
cheering promises God is making them
through His servant.
Chapters vi, vii and viii close the first
division of Zechariah's remarkable visions
or prophecies.
In them he shows the great extent of
the kingdom of the "Branch" and the final
restoration of Jerusalem. With the re¬
building of the Holy City will come the
completion of the Temple, and Haggai, his
associate, assures the people that "The glory
of this latter house shall be greater them of
the former, saith the Lord of hosts; and in
this place will I give peace, saith the Lord
of hosts" (Haggai ii:9).
In this first division are some of the
most remarkable and far-reaching prophe¬
cies to be found in the whole Bible. That
they served their purpose and really and
actually had a good effect upon the nation,
subsequent events fully prove.
