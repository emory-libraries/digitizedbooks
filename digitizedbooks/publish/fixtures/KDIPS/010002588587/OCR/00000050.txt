life And prophecies op zechariah. 45
There is one note ringing through, all the
prophecies of this great man which we must
ever keep in mind, viz: the final restoration
of Jerusalem. As it was the source of "the
living waters" which have refreshed the
earth, watered the thirsty land and turned
the parched desert into a pool, so it shall
again become the centre of Christian activ¬
ity. In the very place where the "Branch"
had been maligned, traduced and murdered,
His standard shall be lifted high above all
others, and upon that banner shall be In¬
scribed "King of Kings and Lord of Lords."
And, if we are to believe prophecy, the
descendants of the very people who once de¬
spised His name shall join in the general re¬
joicing attendant upon His ultimate triumph
over all his foes.
Out of the little that is

of Zechariah. life, we learn that his
prophecies of evil
brought down upon him the anger of the
Jewish people, and that he was foully mur¬
dered by them. Be that as it may, he lives
to-day through his wonderful predictions,
and everywhere men are acknowledging him
as a true servant of God whose words have
been fulfilled in part and are still being veri¬
fied by succeeding ages.
