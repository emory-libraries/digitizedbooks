But its prosperity was of short duration.
The Saracens conquered it and then the
Crusaders subdued it, and finally, in 1516

and its glories ceased. From that time on
it gradually lost prestige and power, and
to-day the desolation and wretchedness of
that once magnificent city are painfully evi¬

dwell amid the ruins of its ancient glory,
eking out a scanty living in insignificant ex¬
ports of cotton, wool and wood.
It is said that such renowned characters
as Frederick Barbarossa and Origen are
buried within the limits of this doomed city.
