History of the Black Phalanx.
we made another, in which Colonel Johnson and three or four men were
wounded. On one of these occasions, while my men were advancing in
face of a sharp fire, a rabbit started up in front of them. With shouts
of laughter, several of them gave chase, showing that even battle could
not obliterate the negro's love of sport.
"But the great day drew near. The weather grew warmer; the ice
gave way. Thomas was ready, and calling together his chiefs, laid be¬
fore them his plan of battle.
"About nine o'clock at night December 14th, 1864,1 was summoned
to General Steadman's headquarters. He told me what the plan of bat¬
tle was, and said he wished me to open the fight by making a vigorous
assault upon Hood's right flank. This, he explained, was to be a feint,
intended to betray Hood into the belief that it was the real attack, and
to lead him to support his right by weakening his left, where Thomas in¬
tended assaulting him in very deed. The General gave me the 14th Uni¬
ted States Colored Infantry, under Colonel H. C. Corbin; the 17th U. S.
C. I., under the gallant Colonel W. K. Shafter; a detachment of the 18th
U. S. C. I., under Major L. D. Joy; the 44th U. S. C. I., under Colonel L.
Johnson; a provisional brigade of white troops under Colonel C. H.
Grosvenor, and a 'section of Artillery, under Captain Osburn, of the
20th Indiana Battery.
" The largest force I had ever handled was two regiments, and as I
rather wanted to open the battle in proper style, I asked General Stead-
man what suggestion he had to make. He replied: 'Colonel, to-mor¬
row morning at daylight I want you to open the battle.' 'All right,
General, do you not think it would be a good plan for me to —and
I outlined a little [plan of attack. With a twinkle in his kindly eye, he
replied: ' To-morrow morning, Colonel, just as soon as you can see how
to put your troops in motion, I wish you to begin the fight.' ' All right,
General, good night.' W}th these explicit instructions, I left his head¬
quarters, returned to camp, and gave the requisite orders for the soldiers
to have an early breakfast, and be ready for serious work at daybreak.
Then taking Adjutant Clelland I reconnoitered the enemy's position,
tracing the line of his camp fires, and decided on my plan of assault.
" The morning dawned with a dense fog, which held us in check for
some time after we were ready to march. During our stay in Nashville,
I was the guest of Major W. B. Lewis, through whose yard ran our line.
He had been a warm personal friend of Andrew Jackson, occupying a
place in the Treasury Department during his administration. He gave
me the room formerly occupied by the hero of New Orleans, and enter¬
tained me with many anecdotes of him. I remember in particular one
which I especially appreciated, because of the scarcity of fuel in our own
camp. At one time General Jackson ordered certain troops to rendez¬
vous for a few days at Nashville. Major Lewis, acting as Quartermaster,
laid in a supply of several hundred cords of wood, which he supposed
would be ample to last during their entire stay in the city. The troops
arrived on a 'raw and gusty day,' and being accustomed to comfortable
