212 History of the Black Phalanx.
jumped to their guns, formed into line and drew their
sabres. Lieut.-Colonel Hall, who was in command of the
2nd Regiment, stepped forward and demanded to know of
the commander of the battery if his men wanted to take
the men the guard had arrested. " Yes," was the officer's
reply, "I want you to give them up." "Not until they
are dealt with," said Colonel Hall. And then a shout and
yell, such as the Phalanx only were able to give, rent the
air, aiid the abortive menance was over. The gunners re¬
turned their sabres and resumed their work. Col. Hall,
who always had perfect control of his men, ordered the
guns stacked, put on a double guard, and the men of the
2nd Regiment resumed their labor of loading the trans¬
port. Of course this was early in the struggle, and before
a general enlistment of the blacks.
The first, second and third regiments of the Phalanx
were the nucleus of the one hundred and eighty that
eventually did so much for the suppression of the rebell¬
ion and the abolition of slavery. The 1st and 3rd Regi¬
ments went up the Mississippi; the 2nd garrisoned Ship
Island and Fort Pike, on Lake Pontchartrain, after pro¬
tecting for several months the Opelousa railroad, so much
coveted by the confederates.
A few weeks after the fight of the 2nd Regiment at
Pascagoula, General Banks laid siege to Port Hudson,
and gathered there all the available forces in his depart¬
ment. Among these were the 1st and 3rd Infantry Regi¬
ments of the Phalanx. On the 23rd of May the federal
forces, having completely invested the enemy's works and
made due preparation, were ordered to make a general
assault along the whole line. The attack was intended to
be simultaneous, but in this it failed. The Union batter¬
ies opened early in the morning, and after a vigorous
bombardment Generals "Weitzel, Grover and Paine, on the
right, assaulted with vigor at 10 A. m., while Gen. Augur
in the center, and General W. T. Sherman on the left, did
not attack till 2 p. m.
Never was fighting more heroic than that of the fed¬
eral army and especially that of the Phalanx regiments
