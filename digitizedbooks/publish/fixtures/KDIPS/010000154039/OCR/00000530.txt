History of the Black Phalanx.
" Had these two regiments failed, or destiny betrayed their courage,
the colored troops would have been universally condemned, and would
not have been employed as soldiers, but used as servants, drivers, and
laborers, on fortifications, bridges, and ditches. To the 2d Louisiana
Native Guards belongs the honor of having had the first colored major
in the army, and it is Major Ernest Dumas, now living and actually in
New Orleans.
"The most terrible engagement (1st and 2d) was at Spanish Fort
in Mobile Bay, Ala., shortly after Fort Pillow's massacre. General
Osterhaus told the colored troops the night previous to the attack that
at break of day they had to charge and take Spanish Fort. It was cus¬
tomary with the general to tell the troops by what regiments they would
be sustained. The men did not seem to be very enthusiastic, but when
they were told how the rebels had murdered men of their own color and
their white fellow-soldiers without mercy, they sprang to their guns and
called unanimously for*' revenge.' Great God! they had their revenge,
sure enough! The charge was made, the fort taken, and nearly every
rebel slaughtered amid the deafening yells of the colored and white
troops of 'Remember Fort Pillow.' The 1st and the 3d regiments
cleared Alabama up to Selina.
"As it is impossible for me to devote my time any longer, and to turn
over the leaves of the past in my clouded memory, which is quite
impaired lately on account of my declining years, besides the metacarpal
bone of my right hand, which was broken by a musket in the army, is
always painful when I write too much, I will refer you to Sergeant Calice
Dupie, of Company H, 1st Louisiana Native Guards, Captain Sauer, who
is employed in the custom house. I am told that Captain jR. H. Isabell,
of the 2d Louisiana Native Guards, has taken a memorandum of all the
historical incidents of those three regiments. They are all Louisianians,
and reside in New Orleans. As for the officers of my regiment (the 3d
Native Guards) they are all dead nearly, which makes me think that my
time soon will be on hand.
" Though my information is limited, I have strictly confined myself
to facts which I am sure will be corroborated by others, I court investi¬
gation upon my statements, and will always be glad to furnish witnesses
to sustain them.
"Fraternally yours, E. LONGPIE,
