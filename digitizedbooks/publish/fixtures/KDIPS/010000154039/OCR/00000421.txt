ealient had not been recaptured. General Sanders mqved his brigade,
consisting of the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and Fourteenth Ala¬
bama Regiments, to the left and occupied the ravine. There was no
shade or water in this ravine, while the men were exposed nearly four
hours to a scorching sun. The heat was almost beyond human endur¬
ance. Strong men fainted and were carried to the rear. The waves of
hot air at times were almost suffocating. For the first and only time
the men were told what was expected of them. General Saunders ex¬
plained the situation to the officers of the regiments. Each captain
spoke to his men, urging them to retake the salient, or Petersburg and
Richmond must be evacuated. The men were ordered to fix their bayo¬
nets securely,to trail arms—not to fire, not to yell, but to move quietly
up the side of the ravine, and then, every man run for his life to the
breastworks. They were told that Generals Lee, Beauregard, Hill, Ma-
hone, Hoke and every general officer of the army would watch them as
they moved forward.
"At 1:30 p. M. the firing had almost ceased and the Federals, over¬
come with heat, did not expect an attack. Saunders formed his brig¬
ade and moved quietly up the side of the ravine. Hardly a word was
spoken, for the Alabamians expected to die or retake that salient. The
eye of General Lee was fixed on them. When they caught sight of the
works their old feelings came back to them and yell they must. With
the fury of a whirlwind they rushed upon the line they had bean ordered
to take. The movement was so unexpected and so quickly executed
that only one shell was thrown into the brigade. The works gained,
they found the enemy on the other side. It was stated that Lee, speak¬
ing to Beauregard, said: ' Splendid!' Beauregard spoke with enthusi¬
asm of the brilliant charge.
"In an instant the Federal army was aroused, and batteries opened
along the whole line, while the infantry fire was a continuous roar.
Only a breastwork divided Wilcox's Brigade from the Federals. A mo¬
ment was required for Saunders to reform, and his brigade mounted the
inner line and forced the enemy backwards to the outer line and the
crater. The crater was full of white and negro soldiers. The Confeder¬
ates, surrounding it on every side, poured volley after volley into this
heaped-up mass of terrified negroes and their brave officers. The ne¬
groes ran in every direction and were shot down without a thought.
Bayonets, swords and the butts of muskets were used. The deafening
roar of artillery and musketry, the yells and imprecations of the com¬
batants, drowned the commands of officers. A negro in the crater
attempted to raise a white flag, and it was instantly pulled down by a
Federal officer. The Federal colors were planted on a huge lump of
dirt, and waved until Sergeant Wallace, of the Eleventh Alabama, fol¬
lowed by others, seized them and tore them from the staff. Instantly a
white flag was raised, and the living, who were not many, surrendered.
The crater was won."
