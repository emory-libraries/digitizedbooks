The War of 1775.

The letter was submitted to Congress, and General
"Washington's action was sustained by the passage of the
following resolution: "That the free negroes, who had
served faithfully in the army at Cambridge, may be re-en¬
listed therein, but no others."
The question of color first entered the army by order
of Washington's predecessor, Gen. Artemus Ward, who
in his first general order required the " complexion " of the
soldier to be entered upon the roll. In October, 1775,
Gen. Thomas wrote the following letter to John Adams.
The general was in every way competent to draw a true
picture of the army, and had the opportunity of observa¬
tion. He says:
"I am sorry to hear that any prejudices should take place in any
Southern Colony, with respect to the troops raised in this. I am certain
that the insinuations you mention are injurious, if we consider with what
precipitation we are obliged to collect an army. In the regiments at
Eoxbury, the privates are equal to any that I served with in the last
war; very few old men, and in the ranks very few boys. Our fifes are
many of them boys. We have some negroes; but I look on them, in gen¬
eral, as equally servicable with other men for fatigue; and in action
many of them have proved themselves brave. I would avoid all reflec¬
tion, or anything that may tend to give umbrage; but there is in this
army from the southward, a number called riflemen, who are the most
indifferent men I ever served with. These privates are mutinous, and
often deserting to the enemy; unwilling for duty of any kind; exceedingly
vicious; and I think the army here would be as well off without them.
But to do justice to their officers, they are, some of them, likely men."
Despite all prejudice, the negro, as in all conflicts
since, sought every opportunity to show his patriotism,
and his unquenchable thirst for liberty; and no matter in
what capacity he entered the service, whether as body-ser¬
vant, hostler or teamster, he always displayed the same
characteristic courage. In November of the same year
the Provincial Congress of South Carolina, by the pas¬
sage of the following resolution, gave permission to her
nilitia officers, to use slaves in the army for certain
Durposes:
iy a large majority, negroes of every description were excluded from enlistment. "When
tie subject was referred to the Committee in conference, the resolve was not adhered to,
,nd probably for the reason here mentioned by Washington. Many black soldiers
cere in the service during all stages Of the war."—Spark's Washine-tnn vni ttt
