History of the Black Phalanx.
It was a year after the black soldiers had become a
part of the Union forces before even a quasi acknowledg¬
ment of their rights as prisoners was noted in Richmond.
The grounds upon which the greatest difficulty lingered
was the refusal of the Federal government at first to
accord belligerent rights to the confederates but this diffi¬
culty was finally overcome in July, 1862, and the ex¬
change of prisoners proceeded with until the confederate
authorities refused to count the black soldiers captured
in the interpretation of the cartel. But the time arrived
when Grant assumed command of the armies, when it was
no longer an open question, for the confederate Congress
began devising plans for arming the slaves.
However, the inhuman treatment did not cease with
"irresponsible parties," whose conduct was doubtless ap¬
proved by the rebel authorities, Jefferson Davis having
declared General Butler an outlaw, and committed him
and his officers and black soldiers to the mercy of a chiv¬
alry which affected to regard them as mercenaries. With
this spirit infused in the confederate army, what else than
barbarity could be expected?
