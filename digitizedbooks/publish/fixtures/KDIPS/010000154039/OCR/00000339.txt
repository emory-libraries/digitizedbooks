The Black Flag.

remembered as strikingly similar to those of Mr. Hog from the West to
"the Eastern market before the invention of the S. F. P. C. T. A.
" 'At Salisbury the prisoners were stored in the third story of an
abandoned tobacco factory, occupied on the lower floors by political
prisoners, deserters, thieves and spies, who during the night made an at¬
tempt on the property of the new-comers, but were repulsed after a
pitched battle. In the morning the Post-Commandant ordered the pris¬
oners to some unusued negro quarters in another part of the grounds,
separated from the latter by a line of sentries. During the week train-
loads of prisoners—enlisted men—arrived and were corralled in the open
grounds. The subsequent sufferings of these men are known to the
country, a parallel to those of Andersonville, as the eternal infamy of
Wirtz is shared by his confrere at Salisbury—McGee.
"' The weakness, and still more, the appalling ferocity of the guards,
stimulated the desire to escape; but when this had become a plan it was
discovered, and the commissioned prisoners were at once hurried off to
Danville, Va., and there assigned the two upper floors of an abandoned
tobacco warehouse, which formed one side of an open square. Here an
organization into messes was effected, from ten to eighteen in each—to
facilitate the issue of rations. The latter consisted of corn-bread and
boiled beef, but gradually the issues of meat became like angels' visits,
and then for several months ceased altogether. It was the art of feeding
as practised by the Hibernian on his horse—only their exchange deprived
the prisoners of testing the one straw per day.
"Among the democracy of hungry bellies there were a few aristocrats,
with a Division General of the Fifth Cofps as Grand Mogul, whose Ma¬
sonic or family connections in the South procured them special privileges.
On the upper floor these envied few erected a cooking stove, around
which they "might be found at all hours of the day, preparing savory
dishes, while encircled by a triple and quadruple row of jealous noses,
eagerly inhailing the escaping vapors, so conducive to day-dreams of
future banquets. The social equilibrium was, however, bi-diurnally re¬
stored by a common pursuit—a general warfare under the black flag
against a common enemy, as insignificant individually as he was collect¬
ively formidable—an insect, in short, whose domesticity on the human
body is, according to some naturalists, one of the differences between
our species and the rest of creation. This operation, technically, 'skir¬
mishing,' happened twice a day, according as the sun illumined the
east or west sides of the apartments, along which the line was deployed
in its beams.
"Eating, sleeping, smelling and skirmishing formed the routine of
prison-life, broken once in a while by a walk, under escort, to the Dan
river, some eighty yards distant, for a water supply. Generally, some
ten or twelve prisoners with buckets were allowed to go at once, and this
circumstance, together with the fact that the guard for all the prisons in
town were mounted in the open square in front, excited the first idea of
escape. According to high diplomatic authority, empty stomachs are
