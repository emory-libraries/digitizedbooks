By Command of Major General, Banks :
RICHARD B. IRWIN,
Official : Assistant Adjutant General.
NATHANIEL BURBANK, Acting Assistant Adjutant General.
General Banks' treatment of the negroes was so very
different from that which they had received from Gen.
Butler,—displacing the negro officers of the first three
regiments organized,—that it rather checkmated recruit¬
ing, so much so that he found it necessary to resort to the
ment, be necessary to secure to them humane and proper treatment, in respect to food,
clothing, compensation for their service, and whatever is necessary to enable them to
support themselves, and to furnish useful service in any capacity to the Government.
Second. You will make similar observation at Columbus, Memphis and other posts
£n your progress to the Headquarters of General Grant's Army.
Third. The President desires that you should confer freely with Major General
Grant, and the officers with whom you may have communication, and explain to them
the importance attached by the Government to the use of the colored population
emancipated by the President's Proclamation, and particularly for the organization of
their labor and military strength. You will cause it to be understood that no officer in
the United States service is regarded as in the discharge of his duties under the Acts of
Congress, the President's Proclamation, and orders of this Department, who fails to em¬
ploy to the utmost extent, the aid and co-operation of the loyal colored population in
performing the labor incident to military operations, and also in performing the duties
of soldiers under proper organization, and that any obstacle thrown in the way of
these ends, is regarded by the President as a violation of the Acts of Congress, and the
declared purposes of the Government in using every means to bring the war to an end.
Fourth. You will ascertain what military officers are willing to take command of
colored troops; ascertain their qualifications for that purpose, and if troops can be
raised and organized, you will, so far as can be done without prejudice to the service,
relieve officers and privates from the service in which they are engaged, to receive com¬
missions such as they may be qualified to exercise in the organization of brigades, regi¬
ments and companies of colored troops. You are authorized in this connection, to
issue in the name of this department, letters of appointment for field and company
officers, and to organize such troops for military service to the utmost extent to which
they can be obtained in accordance with the rules and regulations of the service. You
-will see, more over, and expressly enjoin upon the various staff departments of the ser¬
vice, that such troops are to be provided with supplies upon the requisition of the
proper officers, and in the same manner as other troops in tne service.
