direction and concurrence, were freemen; and it appearing further to this
Assembly, that on the expiration of the term of enlistment of such
slaves, that the former owners have attempted again to force them to
return to a state of servitude, contrary to the principles of justice, and
to their own solemn promise;
" II. And whereas it appears just and reasonable that all persons
enlisted as aforesaid, who have faithfully served agreeable to the terms
of their enlistment, and have hereby of course contributed towards the
establishment of American liberty and independence, should enjoy the
blessings of freedom as a reward for their toils and labors.
"Beit therefore enacted, That each and every slave, who, by the
appointment and direction of his owner, hath enlisted in any regiment
