front and then turn around, and wont we be in their rear? And then
we'll whip them fellows!' pointing in the direction of the force said to be
ia his rear. Jackson and Tyler, charging on the extreme left, drove back
two colored regiments of infantry upon their main line at the cross
roads. In this charge the gallant Captain Tyler was severely wounded.
"Meanwhile the Federals, with desperation, hurled a double line of
battle, with the four guns at Brice's house concentrated upon Rucker and
Bell, which for a moment seemed to stagger and make them waver. In
this terrible onslaught the accomplished Adjutant, Lieutenant W. S.
Pope, of the Seventh Tennessee, was killed, and a third of his regiment
was killed and wounded. Soon another charge was sounded. Lieutenant
Tully Brown was ordered, with his section of three-inch rifles, close on
the front at the Porter house, from which position he hurled a thousand
pounds of cold iron into their stubborn lines. A section of twelve-
pounder howitzers, under Lieutenant B. F. Haller, pressed still further to
the front and within a stone's throw almost of the enemy's line. May-
son's section of three-inch rifles were quickly placed in line with Haller's.
Just then, General Buford, riding up and seeing no support to the artil¬
lery, called General Forrest's attention to the fact, when Forrest re¬
marked : ' Support, h—1; let it support itself; all the d—n Yankees in
the country can't take it.'"
The lines were now closing upon each other, and the
confederates began to feel the effect of the Union fire. The
dash of the Phalanx, charging the enemy's flank, gave re¬
newed courage to the troops, now pouring deadly volleys
into the confederate's faces, and their guns had gained a
position, from which they began to sweep the enemy's
lines.
Says the same account:
"Now rose the regular incessant volleys of musketry and artillery.
The lines in many places were not over thirty paces apart and pistols
were freely used. The smoke of battle almost hid the combatants.
The underbrush and dense black-jack thickets impeded the advance of
the dismounted cavalry as the awful musketry fire blazed and gushed in
the face of these gallant men. Every tree and brush was barked or cut
to the ground by this hail of deadly missiles. It was here the accom¬
plished and gallant William H. Porter, brother of Major Thomas K. and
Governor James D. Porter, fell mortally wounded. This promising
young officer had not attained his manhood. He was a cadet in the
regular Confederate States army and had been ordered to report to Gen¬
eral Bell, who assigned him to duty as A. D. C. Captain J. L. Bell, Gen¬
eral Bell's Assistant Inspector-General, had just been killed from his
horse, and almost at the same moment young Porter lost his own horse
and just mounted Captain Bell's when he received the fatal shot. Lieu¬
tenant Isaac Bell, aide-de-camp of Bell's staff, was severely wounded.
