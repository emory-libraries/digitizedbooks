The Black Flag.
353
" The garrison was summoned in the usual manner, and its com¬
manding officer assumed the responsibility of refusing to surrender after
having been informed by General Forrest of his ability to take the Fort,
and of his fears of what the result would be in case the demand was not
complied with. The assault was made under a heavy fire, and with con¬
siderable loss to the attacking party. Your colors were never lowered,
&nd your garrison never surrendered, but retreated under cover of a
gunboat, with arms in their hands and constants* using them. This was
true particularly of your colored troops, who had been firmly convinced
by your teaching of the certainty of slaughter, in case of capture. Even
under these circumstances, many of your men, white and black, were
taken prisoners."
Continuing, lie says:
" The case under consideration is almost an extreme one. You had
a servile race armed against us. I assert that our officers with all the
circumstances against them endeavored to prevent the effusion of blood."
This is an admission that the massacre of the garri¬
son actually occurred, and because Phalanx troops were
a part of the garrison. That the black soldiers had been
taught that no quarter would be shown them if cap¬
tured, or if they surrendered, is doubtless true. It is also
too true that the teaching was the truth. One has but to
read the summons for the surrender to be satisfied of the
fact, and then recollect that the President of the Confeder¬
ate States, in declaring General Butler an outlaw, also de¬
creed that negroes captured with arms in their hands,
their officers as well, should be turned over to the State
authorities wherein they were captured, to be dealt with
according to the laws of that State and the Confederacy.
The sentiment of the chief confederate commander re¬
garding the employment of negroes in the Union army,
notwithstanding the Confederate Government was the
first to arm and muster them into service, as shown in
previous and later chapters, is manifested by the following
dispatch, though at the time of writing it, that General
had hundreds of blacks under his command at Charleston
building fortifications.
"Charleston, S. C., Oct. 13th, 1862.
" Hon. Wm. P. Miles, Richmond, Ya.
" Has the bill for the execution of abolition prisoners, after January
next, been passed? Do it, and England will be stirred into action. It is
high time to proclaim the black flag after that period; let the execution
be with the garrote. G. T. Beaukegard."
