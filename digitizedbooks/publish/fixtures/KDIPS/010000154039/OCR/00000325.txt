ing civilized nations at war with each, other. But no such
plea can be entered in the case of the confederates, who
starved, shot and murdered 80,000 of their brethren in
prison pens, white prisoners of war. If such treatment
was meted to those of their own color and race, as is
related by an investigating -committee of Senators, what
must have been the treatment of those of another race,—
whom they had held in slavery, and whom they regarded
the same as sheep and horses, to be bought and sold at
will,—when captured in battle, fighting against them for
the Union and their own freedom ?
The report of the Congressional Committee furnishes
ample proof of the barbarities:

1st Session. J \ No. 68,
"IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES.
*'Report of the Joint Committee on the Conduct and Expenditures of
the War,
" On the 4th inst., your committee received a communication of that
date from the Secretary of War, enclosing the report of Colonel Hoff¬
man, commissary general of prisoners, dated May 3, calling the atten¬
tion of the committee to the condition of returned Union prisoners, with
the request that the committee would immediately proceed to Annapolis
and examine with their own eyes the condition of those who have been
returned from rebel captivity. The committee resolved that they would
comply with the request of the Secretary of War ou the first opportu¬
nity. The 5th of May was devoted by the committee to concluding their
labors upon the investigation of the Fort Pillow massacre. On the 6th
of May, however, the committee proceeded to Annapolis and Baltimore,
and examined the condition of our returned soldiers, and took the testi¬
mony of several of them, together with the testimony of surgeons and
other persons in attendance upon the hospitals. That testimony, with
the communication of the Secretary of War, and the report of Colonel
Hoffman, is herewith transmitted.
" The evidence proves, beyond all manner of doubt, a determination
on the part of the rebel authorities, deliberately and persistently prac¬
ticed for a long time past, to subject those of our soldiers who have been
bo unfortunate as to fall in their hands to a system of treatment which
has resulted in reducing many of those who have survived and been per¬
mitted to return to us in a condition, both physically and mentally,
which no language we can use can adequately describe. Though nearly
all the patients now in the Naval Academy hospital at Annapolis, and in
