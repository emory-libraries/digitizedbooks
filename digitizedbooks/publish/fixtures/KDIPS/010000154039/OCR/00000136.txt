History of the Black Phalanx.
ment. However, in no instance did the Phalanx refuse to>
do its duty when called upon, ancl at the sound of the
long roll, though the black flag was raised against them,
and many of their families were suffering at home, their
patriotic ardor never abated in the least. At the North,
provisions were made by the States to relieve the families
of the brave men. Massachusetts sent paymasters to
make good the promises of the Government, but the
deficiency was rejected. Her regiments, although a year
without pay, refused to accept, and demanded full pay
from the Government. The loyal people of the country,
at public meetings and the press,* severely criticised the
* The injustice done the Phalanx, in discriminating between the Northern and
Southern negro, may be clearly seen by the following letters:
"New Victories and Old Wrongs.—To the Editors of the Evening Post: On the
2d of July, at James Island, S. C., a battery was taken by three regiments, under the
following circumstances:
"The regiments were the One Hundred and Third New York (white), the Thirty-
Third United States (formerly First South Carolina Volunteers), and the Fifty-Fifth
Massachusetts, the two last being colored. They marched at one A. M., by the flank,
in the above order, hoping to surprise the battery. As usual the rebels were prepared
for them, and opened upon them as they were deep ii\, one of those almost impassable
Southern marshes. The One Hundred and Third New York, which had previously been
in twenty battles, was thrown into confusion; the Thirty-ThirdUnited States did better,
being behind; the Fifty-Fifth Massachusetts being in the rear, did better still. All three
formed in line, when Colonel Hartwell, commanding the brigade, gave the order to re¬
treat. The officer commanding the Fifty-Fifth Massachusetts, either misunderstanding'
the order, or hearing it countermanded, ordered his regiment to charge. This order
was at once repeated by Major Trowbridge, commanding the Thirty-Third United
States, and by the commander of the One Hundred and Third New York, so that the
three regiments reached the fort in reversed order. The color-bearers of the Thirty-Third
United States and of the Fifty-Fifth Massachusetts had a race to be first in, the lat¬
ter winning. The One Hundred and Third New York entered the battery immediately
after.
" These colored regim&nts are two of the five which were enlisted in South Carolina
and Massachusetts, under the written pledge of the War Department that they should
have the same pay and allowances as white soldiers. That pledge has been deliberately
broken by the War Department, or by Congress, or by both, except as to the short
period, since last New Year's Day. Every one of those killed in this action from these
two colored regiments—under a fire before which the veterans of twenty battles
recoiled—died defrauded by the Government of nearly one-half of his petty pay.
" Mr. Fessenden, who defeated in the Senate the bill for the fulfillment of the con¬
tract with these soldiers, is now Secretary of the Treasury. Was the economy of sav¬
ing six dollars per man worth to the Treasury the ignominy of the repudiation?
"Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, on his triumphal return to his constituents, used to
them this language: ' He had no doubt whatever as to the final result of the present
contest between liberty and slavery. The only doubt he had was whether the nation
had yet been satisfactorily chastised for their cruel oppression of a harmless and long-
suffering race.' Inasmuch as it was Mr. Stevens himself who induced the House of Rep¬
resentatives, most unexpectedly to all, to defeat the Senate bill for the fulfilment of the
national contract with these soldiers, I should think he had excellent reasons for the
doubt. Very respectfully, T. W. HIGGINSON,
July 10, 1864. Col. 1st S. C. Vols, {now33d U. S.)
"To the Editor of the New York Tribune: No one can possibly be so weary of
reading of the wrongs done by Government toward the colored soldiers as I am of
writing about them. This is my only excuse for intruding on your columns again.
By an order of the War Department, dated Aug 1, 1KH4, it is at length ruled that
colored soldiers shall be paid the full pay of soldiers from date of enlistment, provided
they were free on April 19, 1X61,—not otherwise; and this distinction is to be noted on
the pay-rolls. In other words, if one half of a, company escaped from slavery on April
18, 1861, they are to be paid thirteen dollars per month and allowed three dollars and a
half per month for clothing. If the other half were delayed two days, they receive
seven dollars per month and are allowed three dollars per month for precisely the same
