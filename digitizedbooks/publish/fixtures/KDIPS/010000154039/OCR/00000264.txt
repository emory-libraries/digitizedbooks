History of the Black Phalanx,
a surprise. He over-estimates the equanimity of the Confederate coraman*
der if he supposes that that bombardment, which would have waked the
dead, had lulled him into security and repose. The buried cannon were
at once exhumed, the guns remounted and the garrison ordered to their
appointed posts. The Charleston Battalion were already formed and in
position; they had nestled under the parapet and stood ready in their
places. The other troops with the exception of part of one regiment, re¬
sponded to the summons with extraordinary celerity, and the echoes of
the Federal guns had hardly died away before more than three-fourths of
the ramparts were lined with troops; one gap remained unfilled; the de¬
moralized men who should have filled it clung to the bomb-proofs and
stayed there. The gallant Colonel Simpkins called his men to the gun-
chambers wherever guns existed. De Pass, with his light artillery on the
traverse to the left, his guns remounted and untouched, stood ready,
and Colonel Harris moved a howitzer outside the fort to the right to de¬
liver an enfilade fire upon the assailants.
"The dark masses of the enemies columns, brigade after brigade,
were seen in the fading twilight to approach; line after line was formed
and then came the rush. A small creek xnade iu on the right of the fort
and intercepted the enemy's left attack; they did not know it, or did not
estimate it. Orders were given to Gaillard to hold his fire and deliver no
direct shot. It was believed the obstacle presented by the creek would
confuse the assailants, cause them to incline to the right and mingle
their masses at the head of the obstacle and thus their movements
would be obstructed. It seemed to have the anticipated effect and the
assaulting columns apparently jumbled together at this point were met
by the withering volleys of McKethan's direct* and Gaillard's cross-fire
and by the direct discharge of the shell guns, supplemented by the fright¬
ful enfilading discharges of the lighter guns upon the right and left.. It
was terrible, but with an unsurpassed gallantry the Federal soldiers
breasted the storm and rushed onward to the glacis.
" The Confederates, not fourteen hundred strong, with the tenacity
of bull dogs and a fierce courage which was roused to madness by the
frightful inaction to which they had been subjected, poured from the
ramparts and embrasures sheets of flame and atempest of lead and iron,
yet their intrepid assailants rushed on like the waves of the sea by whose
shore they fought. They fell by hundreds, but they pushed on, reeling
under the frightful blasts that almost blew them to pieces, some up to
the Confederate bayonets. The southeast bastion was weakly defended,
and into it a considerable body of the enemy made their way but they
were caught in a trap, for they could not leave it. The fight continued;
but it was impossible to stem the torrent of deadly missiles which poured
out from the fort, the reflux of that terrible tide which had poured in all
day, and the Federals retreated, leaving near a thousand dead around
the fort.
" There was no cessation of the Confederate fire. Sumter and Gregg
threw their shells along with those of Wagner upon the retiring foe; nor
