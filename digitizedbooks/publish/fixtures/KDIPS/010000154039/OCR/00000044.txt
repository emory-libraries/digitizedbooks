History of the Black Phalanx.
" On motion, Resolved, That the colonels of the several regiments of
militia throughout the Colony have leave to enroll such a number of
able male slaves, to be employed as pioneers and laborers, as public
exegencies may require; and that a daily pay of seven shillings and six¬
pence be allowed for the service of each such slave while actually em¬
ployed."
The foregoing resolution must not in any way be
understood as sanctioning the employment of negroes
as soldiers, notwithstanding some of the ablest men of
the State advocated the enlistment of negroes in the army;
the opposition was too strong to carry the measure
through either Congress or the legislature. The feeling
among the Northern colonists may be shown by citing
the views of some of their leading men, and none perhaps
was better calculated to give a clear expression of their
views, than the Rev. Dr. Hopkins, of Newport, R. I., who
wrote a " Dialogue Concerning the slavery of the Afri¬
cans," published soon after the commencement of hostili¬
ties. Here is an extract from a note to the Dialogue:
" God is so ordering it in his providence, that it seems absolutely
necessary something should speedily be done with respect to the slaves
among us, in order to our safety, and to prevent their turning against
us in our present struggle, in order to get their liberty. Our oppressors
have planned to gain the blacks, and induce them to take up arms
against us, by promising them liberty on this condition; and this plan
they are prosecuting to the utmost of their power, by which means they
have persuaded numbers to join them. And should we attempt to
restrain them by force and severity, keeping a strict guard over them,
and punishing them severely who shall be detected in attempting to join
our oppressors, this will only be making bad worse, and serve to render
our inconsistence, oppression, and cruelty more criminal, perspicuous,
and shocking, and bring down the righteous vengeance of Heaven on
our heads. The only way pointed out to prevent this threatening evil is
to set the blacks at liberty ourselves by some public acts and laws, and
then give them proper encouragement to labor, or take arms in the de¬
fence of the American cause, as they shall choose. This would at once
be doing them some degree of justice, and defeating our enemies in the
scheme that they are prosecuting."
Therefore it will be observed that public opinion
regarding the arming of negroes in the North and South,
was controlled by sectional interest in the one, and th,e
love of liberty in the other. That both desired America's
