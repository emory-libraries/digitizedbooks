History of the Black Phalanx.
"But I do most strictly forbid any Person to sell or claim Right
over any Negro, the property of a Rebel, who may take refuge in any
part of this Army: And I do promise to every negro who shall desert
the Rebel Standard, full security to follow within these Lines, any Occu¬
pation which he shall think proper.

of June, 1779. H. Clinton.

It is highly probable that many negroes made their
way to the British camp. Col. Laurens wrote to General
Washington, under date of February, 1780, six months
after the issuing of Sir Henry Clinton's proclamation, as

have repeatedly urged this matter, not only because Congress has recom¬

it executed, but because my own mind suggests the ulility and impor¬
tance of the measure, as the safety of the town maks it necessary.
The project of raising negro troops gained some
friends in all sections, and Statesmen, both South and
North, as they talked about it, became more free to ex¬
press their approbation of the measure. They had wit¬
nessed the militia from Virginia and North Carolina, at
the battle of Camden, throw down their arms before the
enemy ;* they had seen black and white troops under com-

British infantry with fixed bayonets, threw down their arms and fled. A considerabla
part of the North Carolina militia followed their unworthy example. But the Conti
