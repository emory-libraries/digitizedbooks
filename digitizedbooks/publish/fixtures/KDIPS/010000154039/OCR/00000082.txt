vessel, perhaps, whose crew, in part, was not made up of
negroes, as the accounts of various sea fights prove. And
they are entitled to no small share of the meed of praise
given the American seamen, who fought and won victory
over the British. Not only in the Navy, but on board the
privateers,* the American negro did service, as the follow¬
ing extract will show:
" Extract of a Letter from Nathaniel Shaler, Commander of the private'
armed Schooner Gov. Tompkins, to his Agent in New York.

of the ocean."—Nile's Weekly Register, Saturday, Feb. 26,1814.
As in the late war of the rebellion, the negroes offered
their services at the outset when volunteers were called
for, and the true patriots at the North sought to have
their services accepted; but the government being in the
control of the opponents of universal freedom and the
extention of the rights of citizenship to the negro, the
effort to admit him into the ranks of the army, even in
separate organizations, was futile. At the same time
American whites would not enlist to any great extent,

had set in from Ireland, the fighting on shore would prob-
