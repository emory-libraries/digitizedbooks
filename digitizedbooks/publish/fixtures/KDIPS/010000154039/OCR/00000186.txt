History of the Black Phalanx.
General Phelps intended allowing the slaves to gather at
his post, issued the following order:
"New Orleans, May 23,1S62.
•'General,:—You will cause all unemployed persons, black and white, to be exclu¬
ded from your lines. .
" You will not permit either black or white persons to pass your lines, not officers
-and soldiers or belonging to the navy of the United States, without a pass from these
head-quarters, except they are brought in under guard as captured persons, with infor¬
mation, and those to be examined and detained as prisoners of war, if they have been
in arms against the United States, or dismissed and sent away at once, as the case
may be. This does not apply to boats passing up the river without landing within the
lines.
"Provision dealers and marketmen are to be allowed to pass in with provisions
and their wares, but not to remain over night.
"Persons having had their permanent residence within your lines before the occupa¬
tion of our troops, are not to be considered unemployed persons.
" Your officers have reported a large number of servants. Every officer so reported
Employing servants will have the allowance for servants deducted from his pay-roll.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
B. F. Btjtleb.
"Brig.-Gen. Phelps, Commanding Camp Parapet."
This struck Gen. Phelps as an inhuman order, though
Tie obeyed it and placed the slaves just outside of his camp
lines. Here the solders, having drank in the spirit of their
commander, cared for the fugitives from slavery. But
they continued to come, according to divine appointment,
and their increase prompted Gen. Phelps to write this
patriotic, pathetic and eloquent appeal, knowing it must
reach the President:
"Camp Parapet, near Carrollton, La., June 16,1862,
■"Capt. R. S. Davis, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, New Orleans. La,:
"Sir: i enclose herewith, for the information of the major-general commanding
the department, a report of Major Peck, officer of the day, concerning a large number
■of negroes, of both sexes and all ages, who are lying near our pickets, with bag and
baggage, as if they had already commenced an exodus. Many of these negroes have
been sent away from one of the neighboring sugar plantations by their owner, a Mr.
Babilliard La Blanche, who tells them, I am informed, that 'the Yankees are king here
now, and that they must go to their king for food and shelter.'
" They are of that four millions of our colored subjects who have no king or chief,
nor in fact any government that can secure to them the simplest natural rights. They
«an not even be entered into treaty stipulations with and deported to the east, as our
Indian tribes have been to the west. They have no right to the mediation of a justice
of the peace or jury between them and chains and lashes. They have no right to
wages for their labor; no right to the Sabbath; no right to the institution of marriage;
no right to letters or to self-defense. A small class of owners, rendered unfeeling, and
even unconscious and unreflecting by habit, and a large part of them ignorant and
vicious, stand between them and their government, destroying its sovereignty. This
government has not the power even to regulate the number of lashes that its subjects
may receive. It can not say that they shall receive thirty-nine instead of forty. To a
large and growing class of its subjects it can secure neither justice, moderation, nor
the advantages of Christian religion; and if it can not protect all its subjects, it can
protect none, either black or white.
"It is nearly a hundred years since our people first declared to the nations of the
world that all men are born free; and still we have not made our declaration good.
Highly revolutionary measures have since then been adopted by the admission of Mis¬
souri and the annexation of Texas in favor of slavery by the barest majorities of votes
while the highly conservative vote of two-thirds has at length been attained against
slavery, and still slavery exists—even, moreover, although two-thirds of the blood in
the veins of our slaves is fast becoming from our own race. If we wait for a larger
vote, or until our slaves' blood becomes more consanguined still with our own the dan¬
ger of a violent revolution, over which we can have no control, must become more immi¬
nent every day. By a course of undecided action, determined by no policy but the
vague will of a war-distracted people, we run the risk of precipitating that very revolu¬
tionary violence which we seem seeking to avoid.
" Let us regard for a moment the elements of such a revolution
" Many of the slaves here have been sold away from the border States as a punish¬
ment., being too refractory to be dealt with there in the face of the civilization of the
North. They come here with the knowledge of the Christian religion, with its germs
planted and expanding, as it were,in. the dark, rich soil of their African nature, with feel-
