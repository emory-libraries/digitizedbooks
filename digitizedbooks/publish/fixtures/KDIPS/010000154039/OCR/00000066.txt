64 History of the Black Phalanx.
t
ery and valor of the American troops, depended the future
status of the Colonies; hence the solicitude of officers and
of the leading citizens; and it was not the love of universal
freedom, which prompted their efforts for arming negroes;
not at all, but their keen appreciation of the value of a
neutral power, which could be utilized for the benefit of
America's Independence. Nor do I attribute other than the
same motive to the British, who did arm and did free a great
many of the negroes, who joined their service, especially
at the South, where they must have organized quite a
large force,—not less than 5,000. Early in 1781, (Feb'y)
Gen. Greene, then in command in North Carolina, writing
to General Washington about the doings of the enemy in
South Carolina, where he formally commanded, says:
" The enemy have ordered two regiments of negroes to be immedi¬
ately embodied, and are drafting a great portion of the young men of
that State [South Carolina], to serve during the war."
A few days after writing this letter, Gen. Greene met
the British at Guilford Court House, and again witnessed
the cowardice of the Southern militia,* whose conduct
gave victory to the British, under Cornwallis.
The persistency of Col. Laurens in his effort to organ¬
ize negro troops, was still noteworthy. Having returned
from France, whither he went on important business, con¬
nected with the welfare of the States, he resumed his
"favorite pursuit." Under date of May, 19, 1782, in a
letter addressed to Washington, he says :
" The plan which brought me to this country was urged with all the
zeal which the subject inspired, both in our Privy Council and Assembly;
but the single voice of reason was drowned by the howling of a triple-
headed monster, in which prejudice, avarice, and pusillanimity were
united. It was some degree of consolation to me, however, to perceive
that the truth and philosophy had gained some ground; the suffrages in
favor of the measure being twice as numerous as on a former occasion.
Some hopes have been lately given me from Georgia; but I fear, when
* The British loss, in this Rattle, exceeded five hundred in killed and wounded,
among whom were several of the most distinguished officers. The American loss was
about four hundred, in killed and wounded, of which more than three-fourths fell upon
the Continentals. Though the numericial force of Gen. Greene nearly doubled that of
Cornwallis, yet, when we consider the difference between these forces; the shameful con¬
duct of the North Carolina militia, who fled at the first fire; the desertion of the second
Maryland raiment, and that a body of reserve was not brought into action, it will ap¬
pear that our numbers, actually engaged, but little exceeded that of the enemy."—.
