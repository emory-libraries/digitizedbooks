The losses these troops sustained from sickness,
wounds, killed in battle and other casualties incident to

The aggregate negro population in the U. S. in 1860
was 4,449,201, of which 3,950,531 were slaves.

"At the first call for troops in 1861, Governor Dennison was asked if he would accept
negro volunteers. In deference to a sentiment then almost universal, not less than to
the explicit regulations of the Government, he replied that he could not. When the
Emancipation Proclamation changed the status of negroes so completely, and the
Government began to accept their services, they resumed their applications to the
State authorities. Governor Tod still discouraged them. He had previously com¬
mitted himself, in repelling the opportunities of their leaders, to the theory that it
would be contrary to our laws, and without warrant either in their spirit or letter,
to accept them, even under calls for militia. He now did all he could to transfer such
as wished to enlist to the Massachusetts regiments.
"The Adjutant-General, in his report for 18t>3, professed his inability to say why
Massachusetts should be permitted to make Ohio a recruiting-ground for filling her
quotas. If he had looked into the correspondence which the Governor gave to the pub¬
lic in connection with his message, he would have found out. As early as May 11th the
Governor said, in a letter to Hon. Wm. Porter, of Millon, Ohio: 'I do not propose to
raise any colored troops. Those now being recruited in this State are recruited by
authority from Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts.'
" A few days later he wrote to Hon. John M. Langston: ' As it was uncertain what
number of colored men could be promptly raised in Ohio. I have advised and still do
advise, that those disposed to enter the service promptly join the Massachusetts regi¬
ments. * * * Having requested the Governor of Massachusetts to organize
the colored men from Ohio into separate companies, so far as practicable, and also to
keep me fully advised of the names, age, and place of residence of each, Ohio will have
the full benefit of all enlistments from the State, and the recruits themselves the bene¬
fit of the State Associations to the same extent nearly as if organized into a State
regiment.' And to persons proposing to recruit said companies he wrote that all com¬
missions would be issued by the Governor of Massachusetts. In this course he had the
sanction if not the original suggestion of the Secretary of War. Afterward his appli¬
cations for authority to raise an Ohio regiment were for sometime refused, but finally
he secured it, and the One Hundred and Twenty-Seventh was the quick result. Unfor¬
tunately it was numbered the Fifth United States Colored. The result of all this was
that Ohio received credit for little over a third of her colored citizens who volunteered
for the war."—Reid'a Ohio in the War, Vol. I, p. 176.
