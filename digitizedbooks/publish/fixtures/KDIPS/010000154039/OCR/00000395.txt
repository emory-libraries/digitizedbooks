The Phalanx in Virginia.

the "niggers" in order to make them leave the Post, but
in this affair they found a foe worthy of their steel. They
fought for several hours, when finally the confederate
troops beat a retreat. An eye witness of the fight says:
" The chivalry of Fitzhugh Lee and his cavalry division was badly
worsted in the contest last Tuesday with negro troops, composing the
garrison at "Wilson's Landing; the chivalry made a gallant fight, how¬
ever. The battle began at half-past twelve p. m., and ended at six
o'clock, when the chivalry retired, disgusted and defeated. Lee's men
dismounted far in the rear, and fought as infantry; they drove in the
pickets and skirmishers to the intrenchments, and made several valiant
charges upon our works. To make an assault, it was necessary to come
across an opening in front of our position, up to the very edge of a deep
and impassable ravine. The rebels, with deafening yells, made furious
onsets, but the negroes did not flinch, and the mad assailants, discom¬
forted, returned to cover with shrunken ranks. The rebels' fighting was
very wicked; it showed that Lee's heart was bent on taking the negroes
at any cost. Assaults on the center having failed, the rebels tried first
the left, and then the right flank, with no greater success. When the
battle was over, our loss footed up, one man killed outright, twenty
wounded, and two missing. Nineteen rebels were prisoners in our
hands. Lee's losses must have been very heavy; the proof thereof was
left on the ground. Twenty-five rebel bodies lay in the woods unburied,
and pools of blood unmistakably told of other victims taken away.
The estimate, from all the evidence carefully considered, puts the en-
my's casualties at two hundred. Among the corpses Lee left on the
field, was that of Major Breckenridge, of the 2nd Virginia Cavalry.
There is no hesitation here in acknowledging the soldierly qualities
which the colored men engaged in the fight have exhibited. Even the
officers who have hitherto felt no confidence in them are compelled to
express themselves mistaken. General Wilde, commanding the Post,
says that the troops stood tip to their work like veterans."
Newspaper correspondents were not apt to overstate
the facts, nor to give too much favorable coloring to the
Phalanx in those days. Yery much of the sentiment in
the army—East and West—was manufactured by them.
The Democratic partizan press at the North, especially in
New York and Ohio, still engaged in throwing paper bul¬
lets at the negro soldiers, who were shooting lead bullets
at the country's foes.
The gallantry and heroic courage of the Phalanx in
the Departments of the Gulf and South, and their bloody
sacrifices, had not been sufficient to stop the violent
