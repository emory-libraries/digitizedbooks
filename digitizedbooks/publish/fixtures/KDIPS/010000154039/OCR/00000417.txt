sons two hundred feet into the air. The tremendous mass appeared for
a moment to hang suspended in the heavens like a huge, inverted cone,
the exploding powder still flashing out here and there, while limbs and
bodies of mutilated men, and fragments of cannon and wood-work could
be seen, then all fell heavily to the ground again, with a second report
like thunder. When the smoke and dust had cleared away, only an
enormous crater, thirty feet deep, sixty wide, and a hundred and fifty
long stretched out in front of the Ninth Corps, where the rebel fort had
been."
The explosion was the signal for the federal batteries
to open fire, and immediately one hundred and ten guns
and fifty mortars opened along the Union front, lending
to the sublime horror of the upheaved and quaking earth,
the terror of destruction.
A confederate soldier thus describes the explosion, in
the Philadelphia Times, January, 1883:
"About fifteen feet of dirt intervened between the sleeping soldiers
and all this powder. In a moment the superincumbent earth, for a
space forty by eighty feet, was hurled upward, carrying with it the
artillerymen, with their four guns, and three companies of soldiers. As
the huge mass fell backwards it buried the startled men under immense
clods—tons of dirt. Some of the artillery was thrown forty yards
towards the enemy's line. The clay subsoil was broken and piled in
large pieces, often several yards in diameter, which afterwards protected
scores of Federals when surrounded in the crater. The early hour, the
unexpected explosion, the concentrated fire of the enemy's batteries,
startled and wrought confusion among brave men accustomed to
battle."
Says a Union account:
"Now was the time for action, forward went General Ledlie's col¬
umn, with Colonel Marshall's brigade in advance. The parapets were
surmounted, the abatis was quickly removed, and the division pre¬
pared to pass over the intervening ground, and charge through the
still smoking ruins to gain the crest beyond. But here the leading
brigade made a temporary halt; it was said at the time oar men
suspected a counter mine, and were themselves shocked by the ter¬
rible scene they had witnessed. It was, however, but momentary; in
less than a quarter of an hour, the entire division was out of its en¬
trenchments, and was advancing gallantly towards the enemy's line.
The ground was somewhat difficult to cross over, but the troops pushed
steadily on with soldiery bearing, overcoming all the obstacles before
them. They reached the edge of the crater, passed down into the chasm
and attempted to make their way through the yielding sand, the bro-
