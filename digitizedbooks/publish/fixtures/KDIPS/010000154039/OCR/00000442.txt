History of the Black Phalanx.
in the words, 'we will show you how to surrender,' at the same time ris¬
ing and firing into the fort. One of these men I remember to have been
Perry Wallace, Company D. .
"'Upon a consultation of the officers who were in the ditch, it was
decided, to surrender what was left of the command. I was still upon
the face of the parapet, when Lieut. Sherman passed me a handkerchief
•which I raised upon the point of my sword. But the rebels, fearing it
was only done to gain a foothold, would not take notice of it, but called
upon me to come in, which I did, and met with a warm reception at
their hands, being plucked of all they could lay hands upon. An adju¬
tant of an Alabama regiment coming up, ordered his men to return to
me what they had taken, but this was not done, however. I stated that
our men had disarmed themselves and were ready to give up the hope¬
less struggle. Still they would not believe me, but made me mount the
parapet first, when they had the courage to do so themselves, when the
remnant of the four companies marched into the fort.
"' The march to Richmond was one continued insult from the troops
that were hurrying to the front; one man being determined to kill Ca.pt.
"Weiss, whom he thought was not humble enough. The female portion
of the inhabitants were also very insolent.
"'Upon arriving at Libby Prison the officer in charge asked the
commander of our guard if the 'niggers' would fight. His answer was,
'by G—d! if you had been there you would have thought so. They
marched up just as if they were on drill, not firing a shot.'
"'After being lodged in Libby, Salisbury and Danville prisons, we
were returned to Richmond about February 17th, paroled on the 21st,
and reached our lines on the 22d.'
"An article in the New York Herald of November 4th, 1864, copied
from a rebel newspaper, arguing for the arming of slaves, has in it the
following passage:
" 'But A. B. says that negroes will not fight. We have before us a
letter from a distinguished general (we wish we were at liberty to use his
name and influence) who says ' Fort Gilmer proved the other day that
they would fight. They raised each other on the parapet to be shot as
they appeared above.'
" The officer referred to was understood to be Gen. Lee.
"After the four companies had disappeared in the ditch of the fort,
Capt. Pratt, with Company F, was ordered to move forward as near the
work as he could get and keep down its fire and cover their retreat.
Capt Smith and Lieut. Prime came back, both severely wounded. Later
in the day companies A, B, E and I, under Capt. Spaulding, moved to
the left and relieved the four companies of the Eighth, who were out of
ammunition. Co. F lost two men killed and twenty-three wounded, and
the four companies under Capt. Spaulding had eleven men killed and
wounded. Lieut. Teeple, commanding Company I, was wounded in the
arm, but remained in command of his company during the day.
''Four companies annihilated,70 killed, 110 wounded and 129 miss¬
ing tells the story of Fort Gilmer.
" The regiment, or what was left of it, remained at the front until 9
o'clock p M., when the wounded were gathered together and it moved
half a mile to the rear and slept on its arms.
