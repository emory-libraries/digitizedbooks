The Black Flag.
319
Thus it is apparent that while the Confederate Govern¬
ment was holding aloft the black flag, even against the
Northern Phalanx regiments composed of men who were
never slaves, it was at the same time engaged in enrolling
and conscripting slaves to work on fortifications and in
trenches, in support of their rebellion against the United
States, and at a period when negro troops were not ac¬
cepted in the army of the* United States.
Soon after the admission of negroes into the Union
army, it was reported to Secretary Stanton that three
negro soldiers, captured with the gunboat "Isaac Smith,"
on Stone river, were placed in close confinement, where¬
upon he ordered three confederate prisoners belonging to
South Carolina to be placed in close confinement, and in¬
formed the Confederate Government of the action. The
Richmond Examiner becoming cognizant of this said:
"It is not merely the pretension of a regular Government affecting
to deal with 'rebels,' but it is a deadly stab which they are aiming at our
institutions themselves; because they know that, if we were insane
enough to yield this point, to treat black men as the equals of white,
and insurgent slaves as equivalent to our brave white soldiers, the very
foundation of slavery would be fatally wounded."
Several black soldiers were captured in an engagement
before Charleston, and when it came to an exchange of
prisoners, though an immediate exchange of all captured
in the engagement had been agreed upon, the confederates
would not exchange the negro troops. To this the Presi¬
dent's attention was called, whereupon he issued the fol¬
lowing order:
"Executive Mansion, "Washington, July 30th, 1863.
"It is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens,
of whatever color, class, or condition, and especially to those who are
duly organized as soldiers in the public service. The law of nations and
the usages and customs of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit
no distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war, as pub¬
lic enemies. To sell or enslave any captured person, on account of his
color, and for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into bar¬
barism, and a crime against the civilization of the age. The govern¬
ment of the United States will give the same protection to all its soldiers;
and if the enemy shall enslave or sell any one because of his color, the
offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's prisoners in.
