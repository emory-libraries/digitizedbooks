and men who deserve mention, but will respectfully refer you for these to
the reports of division and brigade commanders, yet I cannot refrain
from expressing my high appreciation of the valuable services rendered
by that excellent and dashing officer, Col. Joseph Karge, of the 2nd
New Jersey \ ols., in his reconnoissance to Corinth and his subsequent
management of the rear-guard, during a part of the retreat, fighting
and defending the rear during one whole afternoon and throughout the
entire night following.

7th Ills. Cavalry, A. A. C. S.,—whose names appear in no other report, I
am especially grateful, for the promptness and zeal with which my orders

"Amid these scenes we noted the arrival of 95 more men; those who
had belonged to a raid sent from Memphis, Tenn., under command of
General Sturgis, and were attacked and badly defeated by the rebel
General Forrest, at a place in Mississippi. General Sturgis is said to
have been intoxicated during the engagement, and that just as soon as
he saw things were likely to go against him, he turned away with a por¬
tion of his cavalry, and sought to save himself from capture.— Life and
Death in Rebel Prisons'"
Notwithstanding the arrangements usually and speed¬
ily entered into by two belligerent powers for the exchange
of prisoners of war, it proved a most difficult task for
the Federal Government to consummate an arrangement
with the confederates, and much suffering was caused
among the prisoners in the hands of the latter while nego¬
tiations were in progress. The agreement entered into by
the commissioners, after a long delay, did not anticipate
there being any black soldiers to exchange; nor would
the confederate authorities thereafter allow the terms of
the cartel to apply to the blacks, because Jefferson Davis
and the confederate Congress regarded it as an outrage
against humanity, and the rules of civilized warfare to
arm the negroes against their masters.
