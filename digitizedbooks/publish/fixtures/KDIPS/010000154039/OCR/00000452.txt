450 History of the Black Phalanx.
brigade went forward, but to find the enemy gone and
their works deserted.
The confederate lines were broken, and Sheridan's
troopers, McKenzie and Merritt, with their cavalry, al¬
though it was night, had followed up the fleeing foe,
capturing them by thousands. The brigade pushed on
along the captured works. The federal batteries, from

threatened the enemy. Lee, says a historian, was no
longer himself: he rode wildly through his camps hither,

The defeat at Five Forks settled the fate of the Army
