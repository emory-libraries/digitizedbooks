your committee can refer with pride and satisfaction J and that is the un¬
complaining fortitude, the undiminished patriotism exhibited by our
brave men under all their privations, even in the hour of death.
" Your committee will close their report by quoting the tribute paid
these men by the chaplin of the hospital at Annapolis, who has minis¬
tered to so many of them in their last moments; who has smoothed
their passage to the grave by his kindness and attention, and who has
performed the last sad offices over their lifeless remains. He says:
"' There is another thing I would wish to state. All the men, with¬
out any exception among the thousands that have come to this hospi¬
tal, have never in a single instance expressed a regret (notwithstanding
the privations and sufferings they have endured) that they entered their
country's service. They have been the most loyal, devoted and earnest
men. Even on the last days of their lives they have said that all they
hoped for was just to live and enter the ranks again and meet their foes.
It is a most glorious record in reference to the devotion of our men to
their country. I do not think their patriotism has ever been equalled in
the history of the world.'
"All of which is respectfully submitted.
B. F. WADE, Chairman."

Washington, D. C., May 3,1864.
"Sir:—I have the honor to report that, pursuant to your instruc¬
tions of the 2nd instant, I proceeded, yesterday morning, to Annapolis,
with a view to see that the paroled prisoners about to arrive there from
Richmond were properly received and cared for.
"The flag-of-truce boat 'New York,' under the charge of Major Mul-
ford, with thirty-two officers, three hundred and sixty-three enlisted men,
and one citizen on board, reached the wharf at the Naval School hospi¬
tal about ten o'clock. On going on board, I found the officers generally
in good health, and much cheered by their happy release from the rebel
prisons, and by the prospect of again being with their friends.
"The enlisted men who had endured so many privations at Belle Isle
and other places were, with few exceptions, in a very sad plight, mentally
and physically, having for months been exposed to all the changes of the
weather, with no other protection than a very insufficient supply of
worthless tents, and with an allowance of food scarcely sufficient to pre¬
vent starvation, even if of wholesome quality; but as it was made of
coarsely-ground corn, including the husks, and probably at times the
cobs, if it did not kill by starvation, it was sure to do it by the disease it
created. Some of these poor fellows were wasted to mere skeletons, and
had scarcely life enough remaining to appreciate that they were now in
the hands of their friends, and among them all there were few who had
not become too much broken down and dispirited by their many priva¬
tions to be able to realize the happy prospect of relief from their suffer¬
ings which was before them. With rare exception, every face was sad
