History of the Black Tiialanx.
of Col. Laurens and the advocates of negro soldiery
at the South, the negro was an attache of the Southern
aripy, and rendered efficient aid during the struggle, in
building breastworks, driving teams and piloting the
army through dense woods, swamps, and across rivers.
Not a few were spies and drummers. To select or point out
a particular battle or seige, in which they rendered active
service to the British, would not be a difficult task, though
the information at hand is too limited for a detailed
account of the part which they bore in these struggles.
The true patriots of the Revolution were not slow in
according to their black compatriots that meed of praise
which was their due. In almost every locality, either
North or South, after the war, there lived one or two privi¬
leged negroes, who, on great occasions,—days of muster,
4th of July, Washington's birthday, and the like,—were
treated with more than ordinary courtesy by the other
people. That a great and dastardly wrong was commit¬
ted upon many, in like manner in which Simon Lee* was
treated, is true. Many negroes at the South, who fought
for American independence were re-enslaved, and this is so
far beyond a doubt that no one denies it. The re-enslav¬
ing of these soldiers,—not by those who took part in the
conflict, but the stay-at-home's,—was so flagrant an out¬
rage that the Legislature of Virginia, in 1783, in order to
give freedom to those who had been re-enslaved, and to-
rebuke the injustice of the treatment, passed the following
act:
An Act directing the Emancipation of certain Slaves who had served as
as Soldiers in this State, and for the Emancipation of the Slave,
Aberdeen.
"i. Whereas, it hath, been represented to the present General Assem¬
bly, that, during the course of the war, many persons in this State had
caused their slaves to enlist in certain regiments or corps, raised within
the same, having tendered such slaves to the officers appointed to-
recruit forces within the State, as substitutes for free persons whose lot
or duty it was to serve in such regiments or corps, at the same time rep-
* Simon Lee, the grandfather of William "Wells Brown, on his mother's side, was a
slave in Virffiuia, and served in the war of the Revolution. Although honorably dis¬
charged, with the other Virginia troops, at the close of the war, he was sent back to
his master, where he spent the remainder of his life toiling on a tobacco plantation
