that the people met the troops face to face. This lent
force to the rebellious spirit against the Mother Country,
which the people of the United Northern Colonies had felt
called upon to manifest in public meetings and by written
resolutions. The soldiers were regarded as invaders.
And while the leading men of Boston were discussing and
deliberating as to what steps should be taken to drive the
British troops out of the town, Crispus Attucks, a negro
runaway slave,* led a crowd against the soldiers, with
brave words of encouragement. The soldiers fired upon
them, killing the negro leader, Attucks, first, and then two
white men, and mortally wounding two others. A writer
says:
"The presence of the British soldiers in King Street, excited the
patriotic indignation of the people. The whole community was stirred,
and sage counsellors were deliberating and writing and talking about
the public grievances. But it was not for the 'wise and prudant' to be
first to act against the encroachments of arbitrary power. A motley
rabble of saucy boys, negroes and mulattoes, Irish Jeazues, and out¬

spot. Samuel Maverick and Patrick Carr were mortally wounded. The
excitement which followed was intense. The bells pf the town were rung.
An impromptu town-meeting was held, and an immense assembly was
gathered. Three days after, on the 17th, a public funeral of the martyr
took place. The shops in Boston were closed, and all the bells of Bos¬
ton and the neighboring towns were rung. It is said that a greater
number of persons assembled on this occasion, than ever before gathered
on this continent for a similar purpose. The body of Crispus Attucks,
the mulatto, had been placed in Fanueil Hall with that of Caldwell; both
being strangers in the city. Maverick was buried from his mother'®
