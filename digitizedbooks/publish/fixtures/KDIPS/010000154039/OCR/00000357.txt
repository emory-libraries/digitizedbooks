condition. However, Sturgis marched the troops up at
double-quick to the position where General Grierson was
holding the confederates in check. The infantry had be¬
come so exhausted when they reached the scene of action,
that they were unable to fight as they otherwise would
have done. Sturgis, either ignorant of what was going
on or incapacitated for the work, heightened the disorder
at the front by permitting his train of over two hundred
wagons to be pushed up close to the troops, thus blocking
their rear, and obstructing their manoeuvring; finally the
wagons were parked a short distance from the lines and in
sight of the foe. The troops exhausted by the rapid
march, without proper formation or commanders, had
been brought up to the support of the cavalry, who were
hotly engaged with the enemy, whose desperation was in¬
creased at the sight of the Phalanx regiments. General
Beauford had joined Forrest, augmenting his force 4,000.
Sturgis' force numbered about 12,000, in cavalry, artillery

artillery close behind, Rucker and Johnson following. Meanwhile, Bell,
as we have stated, at Rienzi, eight miles further north, was ordered to
move up at a trot. The roads, soaked with water from recent continu¬
ous heavy rains and so much cut up by the previous passage of cavalry
and trains, greatly retarded the progress of the artillery, so that Rucker
and Johnson soon passed us. On reaching old Carrollville, five miles
northeast of Brice's Cross Roads, heavy firing could be heard just on
ahead. Forrest, as was his custom, had passed to the front of the entire
column with his escort.
" He had, however, ordered Lieutenant R. J. Black, a dashing young
officer, temporarily attached to his staff, to take a detachment of men
from the Seventh Tennessee Cavalry and move forward and develop the
enemy. Black soon reported that he had met the advance of the Federal
cavalry one and a half miles from Brice's Cross Roads and there was
skirmishing with them. General Forrest ordered Lyon to press forward
with his brigade. A courier hastening back to the artillery said: ' Gen¬
eral Forrest says, 'Tell Captain Morton to fetch up the artillery at a gal¬
lop.' Lyon in the meantime had reached the enemy's outposts, dis-
