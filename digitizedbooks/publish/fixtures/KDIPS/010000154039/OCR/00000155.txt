dodging behind trees, rifles in hand, in the extreme distance. In the absence of any
'fugitive master law,' the deserted slaves would be wholly without remedy had not the
crime of treason Riven them right to pursue, capture and bring those persons of whose
benignant protection they have been thus suddenly and cruelly bereft.
" To the third interrogatory, it is my painful duty to reply that I have never re¬
ceived any specific authority for issue of clothing, uniforms, arms, equipments and so
forth, to the troops in question,—my general instructions from Mr. Cameron, to em¬
ploy them in any manner I might find necessary, and the military exigencies of the de¬
partment and the Country, being my only, but I trust, sufficient justification. 'Neither
have I had any specific authority for supplying these persons with shovels, spades, and
pickaxes, when employing them as laborers; nor with boats and oars, when using
them as lighter-men; but these are not points included in Mr. Wickliffe's resolution. To
me it seemed that liberty to employ men in any particular capacity implied and carried
with it liberty, also, to supply them with the necessary tools; and, acting upon this
faith, I have clothed, equiped, and armed the only loyal regiment yet raised in South
Carolina, Georgia or Florida.
"I must say, in vindication of my own conduct, that, had it not been for the many
other diversified and imperative claims on my time and attention, a much more satis¬
factory result might to have been achieved; and that, in place of only One regiment, as
at present, at least five or six well-drilled, and thoroughly acclimated regiments should,
by this time, have been added to the loyal forces of the Union.
" The experiment of arming the blacks, so far as I have made it, has been a com¬
plete and even marvellous success. They are sober, docile, attentive, and enthusiastic;
displaying great natural capacities in acquiring the duties of the soldier. They are
now eager beyond all things to take the field and be led into action; and it is the unani¬
mous opinion of the officers who have had charge of them that, •in the peculiarities of
this climate and country, they will prove invaluable auxiliaries, fully equal to the simi¬
lar regiments so long and successfully used by the British authorities in the West India
Islands.
"In conclusion, I would say, it is my hope—there appearing no possibility of other
reinforcements, owing to the exigencies of the campaign in the Peninsula—to have or¬
ganized by the end of next fall, and be able to present to the government, from forty-
eight to fifty thousand of these hardy and devoted soldiers.
" Trusting that this letter may be made part of your answer to Mr. "Wickliffe's
resolutions, I have the honor to be,
Very respectfully your most obedient servant,
DAVID HUNTER, Maj.-Gen. Commanding."
" This missive was duly sent, with many misgivings that it would not
get through the routine of the War Department in time to be laid before
Congress previous to the adjournment of that honorable body which
was then imminent. There were fears; too, that the Secretary of War
might think it not sufficiently respectful, or serious in its tone; but such
apprehensions proved unfounded. The moment it was received and read
in the War Department, it was hurried down to the House, and delivered,
ore retundo, from the clerk's desk.
"Here its effects were magical. The clerk could scarcely read it with
decorum; nor could half his words be heard amidst the universal peals
of laughter in which both Democrats and Republicans appeared to vie as
to which should be the more noisy. Mr. Wickliffe, who only entered dur-
the reading of the latter half of the document, rose to his feet in a frenzy
of indication, complaining that the reply, of which he had only heard
some portion, was an insult to the dignity of the House, and should be
severely noticed. The more he raved and gesticulated, the more irre-
pressibly did his colleagues, on both sides of the slavery question,
