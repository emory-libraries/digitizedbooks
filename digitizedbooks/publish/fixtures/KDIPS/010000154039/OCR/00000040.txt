History of the Black Phalanx.
Hill, Saratoga. Erected by the town, 1882." Peter Salem was the
colored man who particularly distinguished himself in the revolutionary
war by shooting down Major Pitcairn at the battle of Bunker Hill, as he
was mounting a redoubt and shouting, "The day is ours!" this being
the time when Pitcairn fell back into the arms of his son. Peter Salem
served faithfully in the war for seven years in the companies of minute
men under the command of Capt. John Nixon and Capt. Simon Edgell of
Framingham, and came out of it unharmed. He was a slave, and was
owned, originally, by Capt Jeremiah Belknap of Framingham, being
sold by him to Major Lawson Buckminster of that town, he becoming a
free man when he joined the army. Salem was born in Framingham,
and, in 1783, married Katie Benson, a Granddaughter of Nero, living
for a time near what is now the State muster field. He removed to Lei¬
cester after the close of the war, his last abode in that town being a
cabin on the road leading from Leicester to Auburn. He was removed
to Framingham, where he had gained a settlement in 1816 and there
he died."
Salem was not the only negro at the battle of Bunker

artist, then acting as adjutant, was stationed with his regiment at Rox-
bury, and saw the action from this point. The picture was painted in
1786 when the event was fresh in his mind. It is a significant historical
fact, pertinent to our present research, that, among the limited number
of figures introduced on the canvas, more than one negro soldier can be
distinctly seen."
Of the others who participated in the battle we have
knowledge of Salem Poor, whose bravery won for him fav¬
orable comment.
Major Wm. Lawrence, who fought through the war for
independence, from Concord, until the peace of 1783, par¬
ticipating in many of the severest battles of the war.
Says a memoir:
"At Bunker Hill, where he was slightly wounded, his coat and hat
were pierced with the balls of the enemy, and were preserved in the fam¬
ily for several years. At one time he commanded a company whose
rank and file were all negroes, of whose courage, military discipline, and
fidelity, he always spoke with respect. On one occasion, being out recon-
noitering with his company, he got so far in advance of his command
that he was surrounded, and on the point of being made prisoner by the
enemy. The men, soon discovering his peril, rushed to his rescue, and
fought with the most determined bravery till that rescue was effectually
