The Phalanx in Virginia.

ed. The soil was literally saturated with blood. General Bartlett was
here, with his steel leg broken. He did not look as though he had been
at a ' diamond wedding,' but was present at a ' dance of death.' A cov¬
ered way for artillery was so full of dead that details were made to
throw them out, that artillery might be brought in. The dead bodies
formed a heap on each side. The Alabamians captured thirty-four offi¬
cers, five hundred and thirty-six white and one hundred and thirty-nine
colored soldiers. The three brigades had seventeen stands of colors,
held by seventeen as brave, sweaty, dirty, powder-stained fellows as
ever wore the gray, who knew that, when presenting their colors to
division headquarters, to each a furlough of thirty days would be
granted.
" The crater was filled with wounded, to whom our men gave water.
Adjutant Morgan Cleveland, of the 8th Alabama Regiment, assisted a
federal captain who was mortally wounded and suffering intensely.
Near him lay a burly, wounded negro. The officer said he would die.
The negro, raising himself on his elbow, cried out: 'Thank God. You
killed my brother when we charged, because he was afraid and ran.
Now the rebels have killed you.' Death soon ended the suffering of one
and the hatred of the other. A darkness came down on the battle-field
and the victors began to repair the salient. The crater was cleared of
the dead and wounded. Men were found buried ten feet under the dirt,
Twenty-two of the artillery company were missing. Four hundred and
ninety-eight dead and wounded confederates were buried or sent to the
hospitals. Between the lines lay hundreds of wounded federals, who
vainly called for water. These men had been without water since early
morning. Some calling louder than others, their voices were recognized,
and as their cries grew fainter, we knew their lives were ebbing away.
Our men, risking their lives, carried water to some.
"I find in my diary these lines: 'Sunday, July 31, 1864. Every¬
thing comparatively quiet along the lines. Hundreds of federal soldiers
are lying in front of the crater exposed to a scorching sun; some are
crying for water. The enemy's fire is too heavy for a soldier to expose
himself.' Late on Sunday evening a flag of truce was sent in and for¬
warded to General Lee. General Grant had asked permission to bury
his dead and remove his wounded. The truce was granted, to begin on
Monday at 5 a. m. and conclude at 9 a. m. Punctual to the hour the
federal details came on the field and by 9 a. m. had buried about three
hundred. The work was hardly begun and the truce was extended.
Hour after hour was granted until it was evening before the field was
cleared."
With these selections from the mass of confederate
testimony before us, of their "daring, bloody work,"
given by participants, it is well to read some of the state¬
ments of those who battled for the Union on that occa¬
sion.
