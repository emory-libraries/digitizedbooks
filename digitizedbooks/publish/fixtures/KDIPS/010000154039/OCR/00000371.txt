their camps; keeping their troops always in hand and ready to act on a
moment's notice. That it was impossible to gain any accurate or reli¬
able information of the enemy, and that it behooved us to move
and act constantly as though in his presence. That we were now where
we might encounter him at any moment, and that we must under no
circumstances allow ourselves to be surprised. On the morning of the
10th, the cavalry marched at half-past 5 o'clock and the infantry at
seven, thus allowing the infantry to follow immediately in rear of the
cavalry as it would take the cavalry a full hour and a half to clear
their camp, The habitual order of march was as follows, viz: Cavalry
with its artillery in advance; infantry with its artillery; next, and lastly,
the supply train, guarded by the rear brigade with one of its regiments
at the head, one near the middle and one with a section of artillery in
the rear. A company of pioneers preceded the infantry for the purpose
of repairing the roads, building bridges, &c., &c.
" On this morning, I had preceded the head of the infantry column
and arrived at a point some five miles from camp, when I found an un¬
usually bad place in the road and one that would require considerable
time and labor to render practicable. While baited here to await the
head of the column, I received a message from General Grierson that he
had encountered a portion of the enemy's cavalry. In a few minutes
more I received another message from him, saying the enemy numbered
some 600 and were on the Baldwyn road. That he was himself at
Brice's Cross-Roads and that his position was a good one and he would
hold it. He was then directed to leave 600 or 700 men at the cross¬
roads, to precede the infantry on its arrival, on its march towards Gun-
town, and with the remainder of his forces to drive the enemy toward
Baldwyn and there rejoin the main body by way of the line of the rail¬
road, as I did not intend being drawn from my main purpose. Colonel
McMillen arrived at this time and I rode forward toward the cross-roads.
Before proceeding far, however, I sent a staff officer back directing Colo¬
nel McMillen to move up his advance brigade as rapidly as possible
without distressing his troops. When I reached the cross-roads, found
nearly all the cavalry engaged and the battle growing warm, but no
artillery had yet opened on either side. We had four pieces of artillery
at the cross-roads, but they had not been placed in position, owing to
the dense woods on all sides and the apparent impossibility of using
them to advantage. Finding, however, that our troops were being
hotly pressed, I ordered one section to open on the enemy s reserves.
The enemv's artillery soon replied, and with great accuracy, every shell
bursting over and in the immediate vicinity of our guns.
" Frequent calls were now made for re-enforcements, but until the in¬
fantry should arrive, I had none to give. Colonel Winslow, 4th Iowa
Cavairy, commanding a brigade and occupying a position on the Gun-
town road a little in advance of the cross-roads, was especially clamor¬
ous to be relieved and permitted to carry his brigade to the rear. Fear¬
ing that Colonel Winslow might abandon his position without authority,
