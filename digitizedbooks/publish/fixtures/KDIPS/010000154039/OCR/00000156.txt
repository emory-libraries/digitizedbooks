History of the Black Phalanx.
scream and laugh; until finally, the merriment reached its climax on a
motion made by some member—Schuyler Colfax, if we remember rightly
—that 'as the document appeared to please the honorable gentleman
from Kentucky so much, and as he had not heard the whole of it the
Clerk be now requested to read the whole again'— a motion which wa6
instantaneously carried amid such an uproar of universal merriment
and applause as the frescoed walls of the chamber have seldom heard,
either before or since. It was the great joke of the day, and coming at
a moment of universal gloom in the public mind, was seized upon by the
whole loyal press of the country as a kind of politico-military cham¬
paign cocktail.
" This set that question at rest forever; and not long after, the
proper authorities saw fit to authorize the employment of 'fifty thou¬
sand able-bodied blacks for labor in the Quartermaster's Department,'
and the arming and drilling as soldiers of five thousand of these, but for
the sole purpose of ' protecting the women and children of their fellow-
laborers who might be absent from home in the public service.'
"Here we Save another instance of the reluctance with which the
National Government took up this idea of employing negroes as soldiers;

strengthened the spinal column of the Government in a very marked
degree; although not yet up to the point of fully endorsing and accept¬
ing this daring experiment.
"Meantime the civil authorities of course got wind of what was going
on,—Mr. Henry J. Windsor, special correspondent of the New York
Times, in the Department of the south, having devoted several very
graphic and widely-copied letters to a picture of that new thing unjler
the sun, ' Hunter's negro regiment.'
" Of course the chivalry of the rebellion were incensed beyond meas¬
ure at this last Yankee outrage upon Southern rights. Their papers
teemed with vindictive articles against the commanding general who
had dared to initiate such a novelty. The Savannah Republican, in par¬
ticular, denouncing Hunter as 'the cool-blooded abolition miscreant who,
from his headquarters at Hilton Head, is engaged in executing the
bloody and savage behest of the imperial gorilla who, from his throne of
human bones at "Washington, rules, reigns and riots over the destinies,
of the brutish and degraded North.'
" Mere newspaper abuse, however, by no means gave content to the
outraged feeling of the chivalry. They therefore sent a formal demand
