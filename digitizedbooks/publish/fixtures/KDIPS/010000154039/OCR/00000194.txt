to South Carolina and this point to organize and discipline our African levies, and
that the inore promising' non-commissioned officers and privates of the ariny be ap¬
pointed as company officers to command them. Prompt and energetic efforts in this
direction would probably accomplish more toward a speedy termination of the war,
and an early restoration of peace and unity, than any other course which could be
adopted. , _ , ,

This reply was received:
New Orleans, July 81,1862.
"General:—The general commanding ■wishes you to employ the contrabands in
and about your camp in cutting down ail the trees, &c., between your lines and the
lake, and in forming abatis, according t.o the plan agreed upon between you and Lieu¬
tenant Weitzel when he visited you some time since. What wood is not needed by you
is much needed in this city. For this purpose 1 have ordered the quartermaster to fur¬
nish you with axes, and tents for the contrabands to be quartered in.
"I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
"By order of Major-General Butler.

"To Brigadier-General J. W. Phelps, Camp Parapet."
General Butler's effort to turn the attention of Gen.
Phelps to the law of Congress recently passed was of no
avail, that officer was determined in his policy of war¬
ring on the enemy; but finding General Butler as firm in
his policy of leniency, and knowing of his strong pro-slav¬
ery sentiments prior to the war,—notwithstanding his
" contraband " order at Fortress Monroe,—General Phelps
felt as though he would be humiliated if he departed from
his own policy and became what he regarded as a slave-
driver, therefore he determined to resign. He replied to
General Butler as follows:
"Camp Parapet, La., July 31, 1862.
"Captain R. S. Davis, A. A. A. General, New Orleans, La.:
"Sir:—The communication from your office of this date, signed, 'By order of
Major-General Butler,' directing me to employ the 'contrabands'in and about my camp
in cutting down all the trees between my lines and the lake, etc., has just been received.
" In reply, I must state that while I am willing to prepare African regiments for the
defense of the government against its assailants, I am not willing to become the mere
slave-driver which you propose, having no qualifications in that way. I am, therefore,
under the necessity of tendering the resignation of my commission as an officer of the
army of the United States, and respectfully request a leave of absence until it is accepted,
in accordance with paragraph 29, page 12, of the general regulations.
" While I am writing, at half-past eight o'clock p. m., a colored man is brought in
by one of the pickets who has just been wounded in the side by a charge of shot,
which he says was fired at him by one of a party of three slave-hunters or guerillas, a
mile or more from our line of sentinels. As it is some distance from the camp to the
lake, the party of wood-choppers which you have directed will probably need a con¬
siderable force to guard them against similar attacks.
" I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
"J. W. Phelps, Brigadier-General."
Phelps was one of Butler's most trusted commanders,
and the latter endeavored, but in vain, to have him recon¬
sider his resignation. General Butler wrote him:
New Orleans, August, 2,1862.
" General I was somewhat surprised to receive your resignation for the reasons
stated.
"When you were put in command at Camp Parapet, I sent Lieutenant Weitzel, my
chief engineer, to make a reconnoissance of the lines of Carrollton, and I understand it
