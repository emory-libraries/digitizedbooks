The Phalanx in Virginia.

Then began an activity at the North, East and "West,
such as was never before witnessed. The loyal heart was
again aroused by the President's call for troops, and all
realized the necessity of a more sagacious policy, and the
importance of bringing the war to a close. The lion of
the South must be bearded in his lair, and forced to
surrender Kichmond, the Confederate Capitol, that had
already cost the Government millions of dollars, and the
North thousands of lives. The cockade city,—Petersburg,
—like the Gibralter of the Mississippi, should haul down
the confederate banner from her breastworks; in fact, Lee
must be vanquished. That was the demand of the loyal
nation, and right well did they enter into preparations to
consummate it; placing brave and skillful officers in com¬
mand.
The whole North became a recruiting station. Sum¬

Greeley, Beecher, Philips and Curtis, with the press, had
succeeded in placing the fight upon the highest plane of
civilization, and linked freedom to the cause of the Union
thus making the success of one the success of the other,—
"Liberty and Union, one and inseparable." What patri¬
otism should fail in accomplishing, bounties—National,
State, county, city and township—were to induce and
effect. The depleted ranks of the army were filled to
its maximum, and with a hitherto victorious and gallant
leader would be hurled against the fortifications of the
Confederacy with new energy and determination.
Early in January, General Burnside was ordered again
to take command of the Ninth Army Corps, and to re¬
cruit its strength to fifty thousand effective men, which he
immediately began to do. General Butler, then in com¬
mand of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina,
began the organization of the Army of the James, collect¬
ing at Norfolk, Portsmouth and on the Peninsula, the
forces scattered throughout his Department, and to re¬
cruit Phalanx regiments. In March, General Grant was
called to Washington, and received the appointment of
Lieutenant General, and placed in command of the armies
