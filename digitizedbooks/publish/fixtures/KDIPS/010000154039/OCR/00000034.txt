History of the Black Phalanx.
the first blood for the Independence of America, and lie
thus presents the case to a Boston audience yet smarting
under the insult and sting given them by the British
soldiery:
" But I forbear, and come reluctantly to the transactions of that
dismal night, when in such quick succession, we felt the extremes of
grief, astonishment and rage; when Heaven, in anger, for a dreadful
moment suffered Hell to take the reins; when Satan with his chosen band
opened the sluices of New England's blood, and sacrilegiously polluted
our land with the dead bodies of her guiltless sons. Let this sad tale
of death never be told without a tear; let the heaving bosom cause to
burn with a manly indignation at the barbarous story, through the
long tracts of future time; let every parent tell the shameful story to hi&
listening children 'til tears of pity glisten in their eyes, and boiling pas¬
sions shake their tender frames; and whilst the anniversary of that ill-
fated night is kept a jubilee in the grim court of pandemonium, let all
America join in one common prayer to Heaven, that the inhuman,
unprovoked murders of the 5th of March, 1770, planned by Hillsbor¬
ough and a knot of treacherous knaves in Boston, and executed by the
cruel hand of Preston and his sanguinary coadjutors, may ever stand in
history without a parallel. But what, my countrymen, withheld the'
ready arm of vengeance from executing instant justice on the vile assas¬
sins ? Perhaps you feared promiscuous carnage might ensue, and that
the innocent might share the fate of those who had performed the infer¬
nal deed. But were not all guilty ? Were you not too tender of the lives,
of those who came to fix a yoke on your necks? But I must not too
severely blame you for a fault which great souls only can commit. May
that magnificence of spirit which scorns the low pursuit of malice; may
that generous compassion which often preserves from ruin, even a guilty
villain, forever actuate the noble bosoms of Americans! But let not the
miscreant host vainly imagine that we feared their arms. No, those we-
despised; we dread nothing but slavery. Death is the creature of a pol¬
troon's brains; 'tis immortality to sacrifice ourselves for the salvation
of our country. "VVe fear not death. That gloomy night, the pale-face
moon, and the affrighted stars that hurried through the sky, can wit¬
ness that we fear not death. Our hearts, which, at -the recollection,
glow with rage that four revolving years have scarcely taught us to re¬
strain, can witness that we fear not death; and happy it is for those who
dared to insult us, that their naked bones are not now piled up an ever¬
lasting monument of Massachusett's bravery. But they retired; they
fled, and in that flight they found their only safety. We then expected
that the hand of public justice would soon inflict that punishment upon
the murderers, which, by the laws of God and man, they had incurred.
But let the unbiassed pen of a Robertson, or perhaps of some equally
famed American, conduct this trial before the great tribunal of succeed-
