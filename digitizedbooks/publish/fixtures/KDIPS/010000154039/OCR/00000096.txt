History of the Black Phalanx.
rebellion of 1861-5, some Western regiments had one or
two negroes and Indians in them, but there was no general
enlistment of either race in white regiments.* T,he objec¬
tion was on acconnt of color, or, as some writers claim,
by the fact of the races—negro and Indian f—having been
enslaved. Be the cause what it may, a prejudice, strong,
unrelenting, barred the two races from enjoying wTith the
white race equal civil and political rights in the United
States. So very strong had that prejudice grown since
the Revolution, enhanced it may be by slavery and docil¬
ity, that when the rebellion of 1861 burst forth, a feeling
stronger than law, like a Chinese wall only more impreg¬
nable, encircled the negro, and formed a barrier betwixt
him and the army. Doubtless peace—a long peace—lent
its aid materially to this state of affairs. Wealth, chiefly,
was the dream of the American from 1815 to 1860, nearly
half a century; a period in which the negro was friendless,
save in a few strong-minded, iron-hearted men like John
Brown in Kansas. Wendell Philips in New England, Charles
Sumner in the United States Senate, Horace Greeley in
New York and a few others, who dared, in the face of
strong public sentiment, to plead his cause, even from a

church, were the locations accorded him. The church lent
its influence to the rancor and bitterness of a prejudice as
deadly as the sap of the Upas.
To describe public opinion respecting the negro a half
a century ago, is no easy task. It was just budding into
* I arrived in New York in August, 1862, from Valparaiso, Chili, on the steamship
"Bio-Bio," of Boston, and in company with two Spaniards, neither of whom could
speak English, enlisted in a New York regiment. We were sent to the rendezvous on
one of the islands in the harbor. The third day after we arrived at the barracks, I
was sent with one of my companions to carry water to the cook, an a>?ed negro, who
immediately recognized me, and in such a way as to attract the attention of the cor¬
poral, who reported the matter to the commanding officer, and before I could Rive the
cook the hint, he was examined by the officer of the day. At noon I was accompanied
by a guard of honor to the launch, which landed me in New York. I was a necro

discharged, however, without receiving a certificate to that effect.
