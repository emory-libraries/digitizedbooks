maturity when DeTocqueville visited the United States,
and, as a result of that visit, he wrote, from observation,
a pointed criticism upon the manners and customs, and
the laws of the people of the United States. For fear that
I might be thought over-doing—heightening—giving too
much coloring to the strength, and extent and power of
the prejudice against the negro I quote from that distin¬
guished writer, as he clearly expressed himself under the
heading, "Present and Future condition of the three races
inhabiting the United StatesHe said of the negro:
I see that in a certain portion of the United States at the present
day, the legal barrier which separates the two races is tending to fall
away, but not that which exists in the manners of the country. Slavery
recedes, but the prejudice to which it has given birth remains stationary.
Whosoever has inhabited the United States, must have perceived, that
in those parts of the United States, in which the negroes are no longer
slaves, they have in nowise drawn nearer the whites; on the contrary,
the prejudice of the race appears to be stronger in those States which
have abolished slavery, than in those where it still exists. And, nowhere
is it so intolerant as in the states where servitude has never been known.
It is true , that in the North of the Union, marriages may be legally con¬
tracted between negroes and whites, but public opinion would stigmatize
a man, who should content himself with a negress, as infamous. If
oppressed, they may bring an action at law, but they will find none but
whites among their judges, and although they may legally serve as
jurors, prejudice repulses them for that office. In theatres gold cannot
procure 4 seat for the servile race beside their former masters, in hospi¬
tals they lie apart. They, are allowed to invoke the same divinity as the
whites. The gates of heaven are not closed against those unhappy
beings; but their inferiority is continued to the very confines of the other
world. The negro is free, but he can share, neither the rights, nor the
labor, nor the afflictions of him, whose equal he has been declared to be,
and he cannot meet him upon fair terms in life or death."
DeTocqueville, as is seen, wrote with much bitterness
and sarcasm, and, it is but fair to state, makes no allu-
usion to any exceptions to the various conditions of
affairs that he mentions. In all cases matters might not
have been exactly as bad as he pictures them, but as far
as the deep-seated prejudice against the negroes, and indif¬
ference to their rights and elevation are concerned, the
facts will freely sustain the views so forcibly presented.
