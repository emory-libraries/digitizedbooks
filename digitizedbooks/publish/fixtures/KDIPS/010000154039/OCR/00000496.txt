History of the Black Phalanx.
" February 22nd.—Yesterday the Senate postponed action on the
negro bill. What this means I cannot conjecture, unless there are dis¬
patches from abroad with assurance of recognition, based on stipula¬
tions of emancipation, which can not be carried into effect without the
consent of the States, and a majority of these seem in a fair way of
falling into the hands of the Federal generals."
" February 24th.—Yesterday the Senate voted down the bill to put
200,000 negroes into the army. The papers to-day contain a letter
from General Lee, advocating the measure as a necessity. Mr. Hunter's*
vote defeated it. He has many negroes, and will probably lose them;
but the loss of popularity and fear of forfeiting all chance of the succes¬
sion may have operated, upon him as a politician. What madness!
'Under which king, Benzonian?'"
" February 25th.—Mr. Hunter's eyes seem blood-shot since he voted
against Lee's plan of organizing negro troops."
"February 26 th.—Mr. Hunter is now reproached by the slave-holders
he thought to please for defeating the negro bill. They say his vote will
make Virginia a free State, inasmuch as General Lee must evacuate it
for want of negro troops."
" March 2d.—Negro bill still hangs fire in Congress."
" March 9th.—Yesterday the Senate passed the negro troops bill—
Mr. Hunter voting for it under instruction."
"March 10th.—The president has the reins now, and Congress will
be more obedient; but can they leave the city? Advertisements for
recruiting negro troops are in the papers this morning."
"March 17th.—We shall have a negro army. Letters are pouring
into the department from men of military skill and character asking
authority to raise companies, battalions, and regiments of negro troops.
It is a desperate remedy for the desperate case, and may be successful.
If 200,000 efficient soldiers can be made of this material there is no con¬
jecturing when the next campaign may end. Possibly ' over the border
for a little success will elate our spirits extravagantly, and the blackened
ruins of our towns, and the moans of women and children bereft of
shelter, will appeal strongly to the army for vengeance."
" March 19th.—Unless food and men can be had Virginia must be
lost. The negro experiment will soon be tested. Curtis says that the
letters are pouring into the department from all quarters asking
authority to raise and command negro troops. 100,000 troops from
this source might do wonders."
* It was upon the discussion of this bill that Mr. Hunter, of Virginia, made these
significant statements and admissions:
" When we left the old government we thought we had got rid forever of the slavery-
agitation; but, to my surprise, I find that this (the Confederate) Government assumes
power to arm the slaves, which involves also the power of emancipation. This propo¬
sition would be regarded as a confession 9f despair. If we are right in passing this
measure, we are wrong in denying to the old government the right to interfere with
Blavery and to emancipate slaves. If we offer the slaves their freedom as a boon we
confess that we are insincere and hypocritical in saying slavery was the best state for
the negroes themselves. I believe that the arming and emancipating the slaves will be
an abandonment of the contest. To arm the negroes is to give them freedom. When
they come out scarred from the conflict they mast be free."
