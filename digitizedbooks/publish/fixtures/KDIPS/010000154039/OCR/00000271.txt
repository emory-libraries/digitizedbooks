only when their line officers and three hundred and fifty of their valient
soldiers were dead upon the field, the work of an hour and a half. The
battery lost forty of its horses and four1 of its brave men. The Phalanx
saved the colors of the battery with its own. Col. Barton's brigade, the
47th, 48th and 115th New York, during the fight on the right had held
the enemy in the front and center at bay, covering Elder's battery, and
nobly did they do their duty, bravely maintaining the reputation they
had won before Charleston, but like the other troops, the contest was
too unequal. The rebels outnumbered them five to one, and they like¬
wise gave way, leaving about a fourth of their number upon the field,
dead and wounded.
"Col. Montgomery's brigade, comprising two Phalanx regiments,
54th Massachusetts and 1st North Carolina, which had been held in re¬
serve about a mile down the road, now came up at double-quick. They
were under heavy marching orders, with ten days' rations in their knap¬
sacks, besides their cartridge boxes they carried ten rounds in their
overcoat pockets. The road was sandy, and the men often found their
feet beneath the sand, but with their wonted alacrity they speed on up
the road, the 54th leading in almost a locked running step, followed
closely by the 1st North Carolina. As they reached the road intersected
by the railroad they halted in the rear of what remained of Hamilton's
battery, loading a parting shot. The band of the 54th took position
on the side of the road, and while the regiments were unstringing knap¬
sacks as coolly as if about to bivouac, the music of the band burst out
on the sulphureous air, amid the roar of artillery, the rattle of musketry
and the shouts of commands, mingling its soul-stirring strains with the
deafening yells of the charging columns, right, left, and from the rebel
center. Thus on the very edge of the battle, nay, in the battle, the Pha¬
lanx band poured out in heroic measures ' The Star Spangled Banner.'
Its thrilling notes, souring above the battles' gales, aroused to new life
and renewed energy the panting, routed troops, flying in broken and dis¬
ordered ranks from the field. Many of them halted, the New York
troops particularly, and gathered at the battery again, pouring a deadly
volley into the enemy's works and ranks. The 54th had but a moment
to prepare for the task. General Seymour ro.de up and appealed to the
Phalanx to check the enemy and save the army from complete and total
annihilation. Col. Montgomery gave Col. Hallowell the order'For¬
ward,' pointing to the left, and away went the 54th Phalanx regiment
through the woods, down into the swamp, wading up to their knees—in
places where the water reached their hips; yet on they went till they
l-eached terra firma. Soon the regiment stood in line of battle, ready to
ttieet the enemy's advancing cavalry, emerging from the extreme left.
" 'Hold your fire !' the order ran down the line. Indeed, it was try¬
ing. The cavalry had halted but the enemy, in their rifle-pits in the
center of their line, poured volley after volley into the ranks of the Pha¬
lanx, wliicli it wtooil like a wall of granite, holding at bay the rebel cav¬
alry lmnging on th« edge of a pine grove. The 1st Phalanx regiment
