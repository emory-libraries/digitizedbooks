278 History of the Black Phalanx.
ordered to Virginia, to report to the Army of the Poto-
moc, where it arrived on Aug. 8tli. The 55th Massachu¬
setts Regiment was also ordered to the Department of the
South. It left Boston July 21st, 18G3, on the steamer
" Cahawba," and arrived at Newbern on the 25th. After
a few days of rest, to recover from the effects of the voy¬
age, the regiment was put into active service, and per¬
formed a large amount of marching and of the arduous
duties required of a soldier. Many skirmishes and actions
of more or less importance were participated in. February
13th, 1864, the regiment took a steamer for Jacksonville,
Fla, and spent considerable time in that section and at
varioijs points on the St. Johns river. In June the regi¬
ment was ordered to the vicinity of Charleston, and took
part in several of the engagements which occurred in that
neighborhood, always sustaining and adding to the repu¬
tation they were acquiring for bravery and good soldierly
conduct. The regiment passed its entire time of active
service in the department to which it was first sent, and
returned to Boston, Mass., where it was mustered out,
amid great rejoicing, on the 23rd of September, 1865.
The battles in which the 54th Regiment were engaged
were some of the most sanguinary of the war. The last
fight of the regiment, which, like the battle of New Or¬
leans, took place after peace was declared, is thus described
by the Drummer Boy of Company C, Henry A. Monroe, of
New Bedford, Mass.:
BOYKIN'S MILL. *
" One wailing bugle note,— A low and dark ravine
Then at the break of day. Beneath a rugged hill,
"With Martial step and gay, Where stood the Boykin Mill
The army taken its way Spanning the creek, whose rill
From Camden town. Flows dark and deep.
There lay along the path, ^ Only a narrow bank
Defending native land; Where one can scarcely tread;
A daring, desperate band Thick branches meet o'erhead;
Entrenched on either hand Across the mill-pond's bed
In ambuscade. A bridge up-torn.
* Note.—Boykin's Mill, a few miles from Camden, S. C., was the scene of one of the
bloodiest skirmishes that the 54th Regt. ever participated in. We had literally fought
every step of the way from Georgetown to Camden, and the enemy made a last, desper¬
ate stand at this place. No better position could be found for a defense, as the only
approach to it, was by a narrow embankment about 200 yards long, where only one
could walk at a time. The planks of the bridge over the mill-race were torn up, com¬
pelling the troops to cross on the timbers and cross-ties, under a galling Are which
swept the bridge and embankment, rendering it a fearful 'way of death.' The heroes
of Wagner and Olustee did not. shrink from the trial, but actually charged in single
file. The first to step upon the fatal path, went down like grass before the scythe, but
over their prostrate bodies came their comrades, until the enemy, panic-stricken by
such determined daring, abandoned their position and fled.
