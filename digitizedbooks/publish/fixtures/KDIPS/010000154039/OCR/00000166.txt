History of the Black Phalanx.
returned veterans of that organization on the 13th of Jan. 1864, at
Irving Hall. Of this song it may, perhaps, be said, in verity and without
vanity, that, as Gen. Hunter's letter to Mr. Wickliffe had settled the
negro soldiers' controversy in its official and Congressional form, so did
the publication and immediate popular adoption of these verses con¬
clude all argument upon this matter in the mind of the general public.
Its common sense, with a dash of drollery, at once won over the Irish,
who had been the bitterest opponents of the measure, to become its
friends; and from that hour to this, the attacks upon the experiment of
our negro soldiery have been so few and far between that, indeed, they
may be said to have ceased altogether. It ran as follows, and appeared
in the Herald the morning after the banquet as a portion of the report
of the speeches and festivities:
"SAMBO'S RIGHT TO BE KIL'T.
(Air—The Low-Backed Chair.)
Some say it is a burnin' shame
To make the naygurs fight,
An' that the thrade o' being kilt
Belongs but to the white;
But as for me, upon me sowl,
So liberal are we here,
I'll let Sambo be murthered in place o' meself
On every day in the year.

If Sambo's body should stop a ball
That was comin' for me direct;
An' the prod of a Southern bagnet,
So liberal are we here,
I'll resign and let Sambo take it.
On every day in the year.
On everv day in the year boys,
An' wid none o' your nasty pride,
All right in a Southern bagnet prod
Wid Sambo I'll divide.
The men who object to Sambo
Should take his place and fight;
An' it's betther to have a naygur's hue
Than a liver that's wake an' white;
Though Sambo's black as the ace o' spades
His finger a thrigger can pull,
An' his eye runs sthraight on title barrel sight
From under its thatch o* wool.
So hear me all, boys, darlins!
Don't think I'm tippen' you chaff,
The right to be kilt I'll divide wid him,
An' give him the largest half!
"In regard to Hunter's reply to Mr. Wickliffe, we shall only add this
anecdote, told us one day by that brilliant gentleman and scholar, the
Hon " Sunset" Cox, of Ohio (now of New York): ' I tell you, that letter
