History of the Black Phalanx.
his Majesty's standard, unless equal inducements were
offered them by the colonists, and to this he knew the
Southern colonist would not consent. In his reply to Mr.
Laurens, he said:
" The policy of our arming slaves, is, in my opinion a moot point,
unless the enemy set the example. For, should we begin to form battal-
lions of them, I have not the smallest doubt, if the war is to be prosecu¬
ted, of their following us in it, and justifying the measure upon our
own ground. The contest then must be, who can arm fastest. And
where are our arms? Besides, I am not clear that a discrimination will
not render slavery more irksome to those who remain in it. Most of the
good and evil things in this life are judged of by comparison; and I fear
a comparison in this case will be productive of much discontent in those

for his high qualities of character. A commission of lieu¬
tenant-colonel was granted to him by Congress, and he
proceeded to South Carolina to use his personal influence
to induce the Legislature to authorize the enlistment of
negroes. His services in Rhode Island had given him an
opportunity to witness the conduct and worth of the
negro soldier.
Alexander Hamilton in the course of a long letter to
John Jay, relating to the mission of Col. Laurens to
South Carolina, says:
"I foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from
prejudice and self-interest. The contempt we have been taught to enter-
tertain for the blacks makes us fancy many things that are founded
