on Lake Erie, and with which he gained a decisive victory
over the British fleet, under command of Capt Barley:
"Sib,—I have this moment received, by express, the enclosed letter
from General Harrison. If I had officers and men,—and I have no doubt
you will send them,—I could fight the enemy, and proceed up the lake;
but, having no one to command the ' Niagara,' and only one commis¬
sioned lieutenant and two acting lieutenants, whatever my wishes may
be, going out is out of the question. The men that came by Mr, Champ-
lin are a motley set,—blacks, soldiers, and boys. I cannot think you
saw them after they were selected. I am, however, pleased to see any
thing in the shape of a man."—Mackenzie's Life of Perry, vol. 1. pp.
165,166.
Commodore Chauncey then rebuked him in his reply,
and set forth the worth of the negro seaman:
"Sib,—I have been duly honored with your letters of the twenty-
third and twenty-sixth ultimo, and notice your anxiety for men and offi¬
cers. I am equally anxious to furnish you; and no time shall be lost in
sending officers and men to you as soon as the public service will allow
me to send them from this lake. I regret that you are not pleased with
the men sent you by Messrs Champlin and Forest; for, to my knowledge,
a part of them are not surpassed by any seamen we have in the fleet:
and I have yet to learn that the color of the skin, or the cut and trim¬
mings of the coat, can effect a man's qualifications or usefulness. I have
nearly fifty blacks on board of this ship, and many of them are among
my best men; and those people you call soldiers have been to sea from
two to seventeen years; and I presume that you will find them as good
and useful as any men on board of your vessel; at least if you can judge
by comparison; for those which we have on board of this ship are atten¬
tive and obedient, and, as far as I can judge, many of them excellent
seamen: at any rate, the men sent to Lake Erie have been selected with
a view of sending a fair proportion of petty officers and seamen; and I
presume, upon examination, it will be found that they are equal to those
upon this lake.''—Mackenzie's Life of Perry, vol. i. pp. 186,187.
The battle of Lake Erie is the most memorable naval
battle fought with the British; of it Rossiter Johnson, in
his "History of the War of 1812," in the description of
the engagement, says:
"As the question of the fighting qualities of the black man has since
been considerably discussed, it is worth noting that in this bloody and
brilliant battle a large number of Perry's men were negroes."
It was not left to Commodores Chauncey and Perry,
solely, to applaud them; there was not an American war
