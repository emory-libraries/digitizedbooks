"Added to this Major John P. Coleman, of the 6th United States
Colored Heavy Artillery, (those that Forrest's men did not murder at
Fort Pillow), stationed here, has sent you nearly five thousand dollars
for the same fund, and the 57th United States Colored Infantry desire
me, at the next pay-day, to collect one dollar per man, which will swell
the amount to nearly ten thousand dollars. This is a large contribution
from not quite seventeen hundred men, and it could have been made
larger—many of the men donating over half their pay, and in some
instances the whole of it—but it was thought best to limit them.
" Will you please publish this, that the colored Soldiers and their
friends may know that their money has gone forward, and send me a
copy of the paper. " I am, sir, with regard,

ing them readily discovered the necessity of providing a
better place for keeping the money paid them than in their
pocket-books and in the soldier's knapsack. Every pay¬
day these soldiers would carry sums of money to their
officers for safe keeping, until thousands of dollars were
thus deposited, which were often lost in battle. In August,
1864, General Eufus Saxton, military governor of South
Carolina, after mature deliberation as to the best means
to be adopted for the safe keeping of these soldiers' mon¬
ies, established a bank in his department. General Butler
established a similar one at Norfolk, Ya., about' the same
time. At the organization of the Freedmen's Savings and
Trust company, chartered by act of Congress, these insti¬
tutions transferred to the Freedmen's Bank all the monies
on deposit in them, as the war had ceased, and the troops
and officers were being mustered out of the United States
service. The Butler Bank at Norfolk in July, 1865, trans-
