History of the Black Phalanx.
Arago, which sailed at daylight next morning,—the dispatch-steamer
which brought the request' for immediate information' having sustained
some injuries which prevented an immediate return. It was written after
midnight, we may add, in a tornado of thunder and tempest such as has
rarely been known even on that tornado-stricken coast; but loud as were
the pea,ls and vivid the flashes of heaven's artillery, there were at least
two persons within the lines on Hilton Head who were laughing far too
noisily themselves to pay any heed to external clamors. The reply thus
concocted and sent, from an uncorrected manuscript copy now in our
possession, ran as follows:
"HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,
Hilton Head, S. C., June, 1862.
"To the Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.
"Sik:—I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a communication from the Adju¬
tant-General of the Army, dated June 13, 1862, requesting me to furnish you with the
information necessary to answer certain Resolutions introduced in the House of Repre¬
sentatives June 9, 1862, on motion of the Hon. Mr. Wickliffe, of Kentucky; their sub¬
stance being to enquire :
" 1st—Whether I had organized, or was organizing, a regiment of ' fugitive slaves'
in this department.
"2d—Whether any authority had been given to me from the War Department for
such an organization; and
"3rd—Whether I had been furnished, by order of the War Department, with cloth¬
ing, uniforms, arms, equipments, and so forth, for such a force ?
" Only having received the letter at a late hour this evening, I urge forward my an¬
swer in time for the steamer sailing to-morrow morning,—this haste preventing me
from entering, as minutely as I could wish, upon many points of detail, such as the
paramount importance of the subject would seem to call for. But, in view of the near
termination of the present session of Congress, and the wide-spread interest which must
have been awakened by Mr. Wickliffe's resolutions, I prefer sending even this imperfect
answer to waiting the period necessary for the collection of fuller and more comprehen¬
sive data.
"To the first question, therefore, I reply: That no regiment of * fugitive slaves'
has been, or is being, organized in this department. There is, however, a fine regiment
of loyal persons whose late masters are fugitive rebels—men who everywhere fly before
the appearance of the national flag, leaving their loyal and unhappy servants behind
them, to shift, as best they can, for themselves. So far, indeed, are the loyal persons
composing the regiment from seeking to evade the presence of their late owners, that
they are now, one and all, endeavoring with commendable zeal to acquire the drill and
discipline requisite to place them in a position to go in full and effective pursuit pf their
fugacious and traitorous proprietors.
" To the second question, I have the honor to answer that the instructions given to
Brig.-Gen. T. W. Sherman by the Hon. Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War, and
turned over to me, by succession, for my guidance, do distinctly authorize me to em¬
ploy 'all loyal persons offering their service in defence of the Union, and for the sup¬
pression of this rebellion,' in any manner I may see fit, or that circumstances may call
for. There is no restriction as to the character or color of the persons to be employed,
or the nature of the employment—whether civil or military—in which their services may
be used. I conclude, therefore, that I have been authorized to enlist' fugitive slaves' as
soldiers, could any such fugitives be found' in this department. No such characters,
however, have yet appeared within view of our most advanced pickets,—the loyal ne¬
groes everywhere remaining on their plantations tp welcome us, aid us, and supply us
with food, labor and information. It is the masters who have in every instance been
the 'fugitives,' running away from loyal slaves as well as loyal soldiers; and these, as
yet, we have only partially been able to see—chiefly their heads over ramparts, or
