men of all countries to pass judgment on a measure by "which several
millions of human beings of an inferior race—peaceful and contented
laborers in their sphere—are doomed to extermination, while at the same
time they are encouraged to a general assassination of their masters by
the insiduous recommendation to abstain from violence unless in neces¬
sary defence. Our own detestation of those who have attempted the
most execrable measures recorded in the history of guilty man is tem¬
pered by profound contempt for the impotent rage which it discloses. So
far as regards the action of this government on such criminals as may
attempt its execution, I confine myself to informing you that I shall—
unless in your wisdom you deem some other course expedient—deliver to
the several State authorities all commissioned officers of the United
States that may hereafter be captured by our forces in any of the States
embraced in the Proclamation, that they may be dealt with in accor¬
dance with the laws of those States providing for the punishment of
criminals engaged in exciting servile insurrection. The enlisted soldiers
I shall continue to treat as unwilling instruments in the commission of
these crimes, and shall direct tfieir discharge and return to their homes
on the proper and usual parole."

"Sec. 2.—That in the judgment of Congress, the Proclamations of
the President of the United States, dated respectively September 22nd,
1862, and January 1st, 1863, and other measures of the Government of
the United States, and of its authorities, commanders and forces, de¬
signed or intended to emancipate slaves in the Confederate States, or to
abduct such slaves, or to incite them to insurrection, or to employ ne¬
groes in war against the Confederate States, or to overthrow the insti¬
tution of African slavery and bring on a servile war in these States,
would, if successful, produce atrocious consequences, and they are incon¬
sistent with the spirit of those usages which, in modern warfare, prevail
among the civilized nations; they may therefore be lawfully suppressed
by retaliation.
" Sec. 3.—That in every case wherein, during the war, any violation
of the laws and usages of war among civilized nations shall be. or has
been done and perpetrated by those acting under the authority of the
United States, on the persons or property of citizens of the Confederate
