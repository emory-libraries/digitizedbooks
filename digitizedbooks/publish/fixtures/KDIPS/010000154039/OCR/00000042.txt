Franklin, Benjamin Harrison and Thomas Lynch, with
the Deputy Governors of Connecticut and Bhode Island.
This committee met at Cambridge, with a committee of
the council of Massachusetts Bay. The object and duty
of the meeting was to consider the condition of the army,
and to devise means by which it could be improved.
General Washington was present at the meeting, and
took part in the discussions. Among others, the follow¬
ing subject was considered and reported upon: "'Ought
not negroes to be excluded from the new enlistment,
especially those such as are slaves?' All were thought
improper by the council of officers. 1 Agreed, That they
may be rejected altogether.'"
In the organization of the new army, were many offi¬
cers and men, who had served with negroes in the militia,
and who had been re-enlisted in the colonial army. They
protested against the exclusion of their old comrades, on
account of color. So very strong were their protests that
most of the rank and file of the Northern troops regarded
the matter as of serious import to the colonies, and of
danger to the wives and families of those in the field.

in December, 1775:
"It has been represented to me that the free negroes who have served
in this army are very much dissatisfied at being- discarded. As it is to
be apprehended that they may seek employment in the Ministerial army
I have presumed to depart from the resolution respecting them, and
have given license for their being enlisted. If this is disapproved by
Congress, I will put a stop to it." *
* Mr. Sparks appends to this letter the following note: " At a meeting of the gen¬

unanimously resolved, that it was not expedient to enlist slaves in tiie new army j andj
