History of the Black Phalanx.
"It has been, reported to me that all of your colored troops sta¬
tioned in Memphis took, on their knees, in the presence of Major General
Hurlburt and other officers of your army, an oath to avenge Fort Pillow,
and that they would show my toops no quarter. Again I have it from
indisputable authority that the troops under Brigadier General Sturgis
on their recent march from Memphis, publicly, and in many places, pro¬
claimed that no quarter would be shown my men. As they were moved
into action on the 10th they were exhorted by their officers to remember
Fort Pillow. The prisoners we have captured from that command, or a
large majority of them, have voluntarily stated that they expected us to
murder them, otherwise they would have surrendered in a body rather
than have taken to the bushes after being run down and exhausted."
The massacre at Fort Pillow had a very different effect
upon the black soldiers than it was doubtless expected to
have. Instead of weakening their courage it stimulated
them to a desire of retaliation; not in the strict sense of
that term, but to fight with a determination to subdue
and bring to possible punishment, the men guilty of such
atrocious conduct. Had General Sturgis been competent
of commanding, Forrest would have found himself and
his command no match for the Phalanx at Guntown and
Brice's Cross Koads. Doubtless Forrest was startled by
the reply of General Washburn, who justly recognized the
true impulse of the Phalanx. He replied to Forrest, June
19,1864, as follows:
"You say in your letter that it has been reported to you that all the
negro troops stationed in Memphis took an oath, on their knees, in the
presence of Major General Hurlburt and other officers of our army, to
avenge Fort Pillow and that they would show your troops no quarter.
I believe it is true that the colored troops did take such an oath, but not
in the presence of General Hurlburt. From what I can learn this act of
theirs was not influenced by any white officer, but was the result of their
own sense of what was due to themselves and their fellows who had been
mercilessly slaughtered."
The chief of Forrest's artillery writes in the Philadel¬
phia Times, in September, 1883:
"Col. Arthur T. Reeve, who commanded the Fifty-fifth Colored In¬
fantry in this fight, tells me that no oath was taken by his troops that
ever he heard of, but the impression prevailed that the black flag was
raised, and on his side was raised to all intents and purposes. He him¬
self fully expected to be killed if captured. Impressed with this notion a
double effect was produced. It made the Federals afraid to surrender
