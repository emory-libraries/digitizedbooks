History of the Black Phalanx.

soldier to arrive at, when men no braver than himself
were being promoted for bravery.
Generally there was one of three things the negro sol¬
diers could be found doing when at leisure: discussing
religion, cleaning his musket and accoutrements, or trying
to read. His zeal frequently led him to neglect to eat for
the latter. Every camp had a teacher, in fact every com¬
pany had some one to instruct the soldiers in reading, if
nothing more. Since the war I have known of more than
one who have taken up the profession of preaching and
law making, whose first letter was learned in camp; and
not a few who have entered college.
The negro soldier was not only patriotic in the high¬

Colonol G. M. Arnold says:
"Aside from the military duties required of the men forming the
Phalanx regiments, the school teacher was drilling and preparing them
in the comprehension of letters and figures. In nearly every regiment
a school, during the encampment, was- established, in some instances
female teachers from the North, impulsed by that philanthropy which
induced an army of teachers South to teach the freedmen, also brought
them to the barracks and the camp ground to instruct the soldiers of
the Phalanx. Their ambition to learn to read and write was as strong
