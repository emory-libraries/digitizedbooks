The War of 1775.
47
The British were determined, it seems, to utilize all the
available strength they could command, by enlisting1
negroes at the North as well as at the South. They con¬
ceived the idea of forming regiments of them at the North,
as the letter of Gen. Greene to Gen. "Washington will show:
"Camp on Long Island, July 21,1776, two o'clock.
"Sir :—Colonel Hand reports seven large ships are coming up from
the Hook to the Narrows.
"A negro belonging to one Strickler, at Gravesend, was taken
prisoner (as he says) last Sunday at Coney Island. Yesterday he made
his escape, and was taken prisoner by the rifle guard. He reports eight
hundred negroes collected on Staten Island, this day to be formed into a
regiment.

patriotic commendations of the Americans, and revived
the urgent appeals that had been made foK a place in the
armed ranks for all men, irrespective of color. The Penn¬
sylvania Evening Post of Aug. 7th, 1777, gives the follow¬
ing account of the capture:
"They landed about five miles from Newport, and three quarters of
a mile from the house, which they approached cautiously, avoiding the
main guard, which was at some distance. The Colonel went foremost,,
with a stout active negro close behind him, and another at a small dis¬
tance; the rest followed so as to be near but not seen.
"A single sentinel at the door saw and hailed the Colonel; he an¬
