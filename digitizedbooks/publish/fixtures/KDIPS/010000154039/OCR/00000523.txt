and to render it impregnable against a counter attack, which was con¬
stantly expected. While busily engaged in this work the rebels opened
upon us with a fierce artillery fire. A powerful force, said to be under
the direction of General Lee in person, had been silently massed in front
of Fort Harrison, screened from our view by the inequality of the
ground. They soon made their presence known, however, and advanced
with determination. * They were met by a fire that sent them reeling
back with immense loss. Again they formed, and were again driven
back. Another charge more furious, and another repulse more bloody,
finally convinced them that the attempt was useless, and we were left in
possession of our victories of the previous day. After this, compara¬
tive quiet reigned for a few days, but they were not days of idleness; the
captured lines had to be reversed and heavy picket duty to be done, and
of these duties this regiment had its full share.
" On the 7th of October, the enemy made a dash on our right, and
at first met with considerable success. This regiment was detached from
the brigade, and ordered -to the right to assist in repelling the attack.
Before reaching that point the attack had been repulsed and the fighting
was nearly over. We formed a skirmish line and remained until mid¬
night, when we returned to the brigade.
"On the 13th of October a reconnoissance was made upon the
enemy's lines in front of our right, in which this regiment took an active
part. The fighting was severe, and the loss considerable. The men
behaved like veterans: but the wary foe behind his strong works bade
defiance to our small force, and so, after fifteen hours of fighting, at
night we returned to camp. On the 27th of October a movement com¬
menced on our extreme left which required the active co-operation of
the Army of the James, that the enemy might be kept busily engaged
at all points. This regiment, as part of the force selected for this pur¬
pose, set out early on the morning of the 27th, and came in contact with
the outposts of the enemy. Deploying as skirmishers, after a short,
sharp action, we drove the enemy within entrenchments. After driving
in the skirmish line, we remained in front of the enemy's works, picking
his men as opportunity offered, and keeping him engaged generally. We
were in an open field, exposed to the fire of an enemy protected by
strong earthworks. The men behaved very well; for twenty-three hours
they held this position, exposing themselves with the most reckless
indifference, taking the ammunition from the bodies of their dead and
wounded companions when their own was exhausted, and in all respects,
if valor be any criteron of manhood, proving themselves to be 'good
men and true.' At length on the morning of the 28th, the troops were
withdrawn, and we returned to camp.
"On the 19th day of November, the regiment was ordered to garrison
certain detached forts on the New Market road, which were considered
of great importance on account of the relation they bore to the whole
line north of the James. That this regiment was sent to hold them,
was certainly a marked tribute to its valor and efficiency, and wa«
