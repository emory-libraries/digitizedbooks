History of the Black Phalanx.
volunteers to defend that very country from the inroads and ravages of
a ruthless and vindictive foe, which had treated them with insult, degra¬
dation and slavery.
"Volunteers are the best of soldiers. Give me the men, whatever be
their complexion, that willingly volunteer, and not those who are com¬
pelled to turn out. Such men do not fight from necessity, nor from mer-
cinary motives, but from principle."
Hon. Mr. Martindale, who represented a District of
the State of New York, in Congress in 1828, thus speaks
of the negro soldiers:
" Slaves, or negroes who have been slaves, were enlisted as soldiers
in the War of the Kevolution; and I myself saw a battalion of them, as
fine martial-looking men as I ever saw, attached to the Northern army."
Up to this time the East had been the theatre of the
war, with now and then a battle in some one of the Middle
Colonies, but the British discovering that the people of
the South acted indifferently in maintaining and recruit¬
ing the army, transferred their operations to that section.
Maryland then stood as a middle State or Colony. Her
statesmen, seeing the threatened danger of the invasion
of Pennsylvania, endeavored to prepare to meet it, and
taking council from her sister States at the East, accepted
the negro as a soldier. In June, 1781, John Cadwater,
writing from Annapolis, Md., to Gen. Washington, says:
"We have resolved to raise, immediately, seven hundred and fifty
negroes, to be incorporated with the other troops; and a bill is now
almost completed."
It does not appear that the negroes were formed into
separate organizations in this State, but tilled the depleted
ranks of the Continental regiments, where their energy
and daring was not less than that displayed by their
white comrades, with whom they fought, shoulder to
shoulder. The advocates of arming the negroes were not
confined to the Eastern and Middle sections; some of the
best men of the South favored and advocated the enlist¬
ment of free negroes, and made many, though for a long
time unsuccessful, efforts to obtain legal sanction for such
enlistment throughout the South. But their advice was
not listened to, even in the face of certain invasion, and
