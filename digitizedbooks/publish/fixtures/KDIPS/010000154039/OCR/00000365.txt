The Black Flag.

"By this time, all the white troops, except one squadron of cavalry,
that formed in the rear, were on the road to Salem * and, when this brig¬
ade came up, they, too, wheeled and left, and in less than ten minutes
this now little band of colored troops found themselves flanked. They
then divided themselves into three squads, and charged the enemy's lines;
one squad taking the old Corinth Road, then a by-road, to the left.
After a few miles, they came to a road leading to Grand Junction. After
some skirmishing, they arrived, with the loss of one killed and one
wounded.
"Another and the largest squad covered the retreat of the white
troops, completely defending them by picking up the ammunition thrown
away by them, and with it repelling the numerous assaults made by the
rebel cavalry, until they reached Collierville, a distance of sixty miles.
"When the command reached Dan's Mills, the enemy attempted to cut it
off by a charge; but the colored boys in the rear formed, and repelled
the attack, allowing the whole command to pass safely on, when they
tore up the bridge. Passing on to an open country, the officers halted,
and re-organized the brigade into an effective force. They then moved
forward until about four, p. m. ; when some Indian flank skirmishers dis¬
covered the enemy, who came up to the left, and in the rear, and halted.
Soon a portion advanced, when a company faced about and fired, empty¬
ing three saddles. From this time until dark, the skirmishing was
constant.
"A corporal in Company C, Fifty-ninth, was ordered to surrender.
He let his would-be captor come close to him; when he struck him with
the butt of his gun.
" While the regiment was fighting in a ditch, and the order came to
retreat, the color-bearer threw out the flag, designing to jump out and
get it; but the rebels rushed for it, and in the struggle one of the boys
knocked down with his gun the reb who had the flag, caught it, and ran.
"A rebel, with an oath, ordered one of our men to surrender. He,
thinking the reb's gun was loaded, dropped his gun; but, on seeing the
reb commence loading, our colored soldier jumped for his gun, and with
it struck his captor dead.
" Capt. H., being surrounded by about a dozen rebels, was seen by
one of his men, who called several of his companions; they rushed for¬
ward and fired, killing several of the enemy, and rescued their captain.
"A rebel came up to one, and said, 'Come my good fellow, go with
me and wait on me.' In an instant, the boy shot his would-be master
dead.
" Once when the men charged on the enemy, they rushed forth with
the cry,' Remember Fort Pillow.' The rebs called back, and said,' Lee's
men killed no prisoners.'
"One man in a charge threw his antagonist to the ground, and
pinned him fast; and, as he attempted to withdraw his bayonet, it came
off his gun, and, as he was very busy just then, he left him transfixed to
mother earth.
