of the attack on the right. The irregular skirmish fire soon swelled out
into long, heavy volleys, deepened by the hoarser notes of the artillery.
From 8 a. m. until 8 p. m. we lay and listened to this concert of diaboli¬
cal sounds, momentarily expecting the order would be passed along the
line to advance. About 11 a. m. it began to rain, which continued until
far into the night. At 8 p. m. we fell back out of the woods, behind an
old line of rebel rifle-pits, and bivouacked for the night near Kell's
House.
" At 3 o'clock the following morning we were ordered in to relieve
the Twenty-ninth on the picket-line. The clouds had cleared away and
the air was keen and cold. We felt our way through the dense, dripping
undergrowth to the musical accompaniment of rebel bullets singing
above our heads. By daybreak we were in position along the edge of a
belt of woods, something less than a quarter of a mile from the rebel
works. Their skirmishers kept up a lively fire all through the forenoon,
and as a consequence we lost some thirty odd men, killed and wounded,
from their fire. About 3 p. m. orders were given to fall back, but
through some misunderstanding, the two companies holding the ex¬
treme left of the line failed to receive the order, and held their ground
until their retreat was nearly cut off by the rebel advance, when they
fell back without orders, meeting on their way the remainder of the
brigade coming to their rescue. The same evening the troops returned
to their camps.

"On the 28th, Gen. Birney returned and relieved Gen. Hawley in
command of the division, which he had held during the absence of the
former in Philadelphia, where he had gone about the 21st to attend the
funeral of his brother, Maj.-Gen. D. B. Birney. Col. Shaw was placed
permanently in command of the First Brigade, and Col. Wright, Tenth
U. S. C. T., of the Second.
"About the 30th, a general order was received from Gen. Butler
thanking Capt. "Weiss and the officers under him for their gallant con¬
duct on the 29th, and saying that their absence in prison alone pre¬
vented their promotion.
" On the 1st of November, the division was reviewed by Gen. Birney,
and the proclamation of the Governor of Maryland, announcing the
adoption of the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery in that
State, was read to the command. This paper, which conveyed to the
men the knowledge that their wives and children were no longer slaves,
produced an effect more easily imagined than described.

" On the 5th, Capt. Cheney and Lieut. Teeple, with companies H and
I, were detached from the regiment to garrison Fort cNo. 3,' at Spring
Hill— a work on the right flank of the Army of the James—where they
