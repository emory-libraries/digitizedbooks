History of the Black Phalanx.
French were at Yorktown. It cannot be doubted but that
from Charleston to Yorktown the Americans met negro
troops more than once fighting under the Boyal flag;
while at the east, in every important engagement between
the two enemies,—British and American,—the negro was
found fighting with the Americans. This division of the
negroes can easily be accounted for, since at the North and
East the object of the war was acknowledged to be set
forth in the Declaration of Independence; at the South
only so much of the Declaration was accepted as de¬
manded Independence from Great Britain. Therefore,
though in separate and opposing armies, the object of the
negro was the same—liberty. It is to be regretted that
the historians of the Eevolutionary period did not more
particularly chronicle the part taken by negroes at the
South, though enough is known to put their employment
beyond doubt.
Johnson, the author of the life of Gen. Greene, speak¬
ing of Greene's recommendation to the Legislature of
South Carolina to enroll negroes, says:
" There is a sovereign, who, at this time, draws his soldiery from the
same class of people; and finds a facility in forming and disciplining an
army, which no other power enjoys. Nor does his immense military
force, formed from that class of his subjects, excite the least apprehen¬
sion; for the soldier's will is subdued to that of his officer, and his im¬
proved condition takes away the habit of identifying himself with the
class from which he has been separated. Military niCT know what mere
machines men become under discipline, and believe that any men, who
may be obedient, may be made soldiers; and that increasing their num¬
bers increases the means of their own subjection and government."
(now Columbus), in this couhty, in the family of John Hutehins. He enlisted in a com¬
pany commanded by Capt. JLowry, attached to the Second New Jersey Regiment,
Tinder the command of Col. Israel Shreve. He was at the battles of Trenton, Brandy-
wine, Princetown, Mommouth, and Yorktown, at which latter place, he told us, he saw
the last man killed. Although his faculties are failing, yet he relates many interesting
reminiscences of the Revolution. He was with the army at the retreat of the Dela¬
ware, on the memorable crossing of the 25th of December, 1776, and relates the story of
the battle on the succeeding day, with enthusiasm. He gives the details of the march
from Trenton to Princetown, and told us, with much humor, that they 'knocked the
British around lively,' at the latter place. He was also a,t the jbattle of Springfield,
and says that he saw the house burning in which Mrs. Caldwell was shot, at Connecti¬
cut Farms."
"I further learn, (says the author of the 'Colored Patriots of the Revolution')
■that Cromwell was brought up a farmer,|having served his time with Thomas Hutehins
Esq., his maternal uncle. He was, for six years and nine months under the immediate
command of Washington, whom he loved affectionately."
"His discharge," says Dr. M'Cune Smith, "at the close of the war, was in Wash¬
ington's own handwriting, of which he was very proud, often speaking of it. Ho re¬
ceived annually, ninety-six dollars pension. He lived a long and honorable life Had
he been of a little lighter compl"xion, (he was just half white), every newspaper'In the
land would have been eloquent in praise of his many virtues."
