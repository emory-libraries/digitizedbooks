History of the Black Phalanx.
miles from Ripley; issued five days' rations (at previous camp.) Rained
two hours in the evening.
"'Friday, June 10th.—Encountered the enemy at Brice's Cross-
Roads, 23 miles from Ripley and six miles from Guntown.'
"At Ripley it became a serious question in my mind as to whether
or not I should proceed any farther. The rain still fell in torrents; the
artillery and wagons were literally mired down, and the starved and ex¬
hausted animals could with difficulty drag them along. Under these
circumstances, I called together my division commanders and placed
before them my views of our condition. At this interview, one brigade
commander and two members of my staff were, incidentally, present
also. I called their attention to the great delay we had undergone on
account of the continuous rain and consequent bad condition of the
roads; the exhausted condition of our animals; the great probability
that the enemy would avail himself of the time thus afforded him to
concentrate an overwhelming force against us in the vicinity of Tupelo
and the utter hopelessness of saving our train or artillery in case of de¬
feat, on account of the narrowness and general bad condition of the roads
and the impossibility of procuring supplies of forage for the animals;
all agreed with me in the probable consequences of defeat. Some
thought our only safety lay in retracing our steps and abandoning the
expedition. It was urged, however, (and with some propriety, too,)
that inasmuch as I had abandoned a similar expedition only a few weeks
before and given as my reasons for so doing, the " utter and entire desti¬
tution of the country," and that in the face of this we were again sent
through the same country, it would be ruinous on all sides to return
again without first meeting the enemy. Moreover, from all the informa¬
tion General Washburn had acquired, there could be no considerable
force in our front and all my own information led to the same conclu¬
sion. To be sure my information was exceedingly meagre and unsatis¬
factory and had I returned I would have been totally unable to present
any facts to justify my cause, or to show why the expedition might not
have been successfully carried forward. All I could have presented
would have been my conjectures as to what the enemy would naturally
do under the circumstances and these would have availed but little
against the idea that the enemy was scattered and had no considerable
force in our front.
" Under these circumstances, "and with a sad forboding of the con¬
sequences, I determined to move forward; keeping my force as compact
as possible and ready for action at all times; hoping that we might suc¬
ceed,, and feeling that if we did not, yet our losses might at most be in¬
significant in comparison with the great benefits which might accrue to
General Sherman by the depletion of Johnson's army to so large an
extent.
"On the evening of the 8th, one day beyond Ripley,I assembled the com
manders of infantry brigades at the headquarters of Colonel McMillen,
and cautioned them as to the necessity of enforcing rigid discipline in
