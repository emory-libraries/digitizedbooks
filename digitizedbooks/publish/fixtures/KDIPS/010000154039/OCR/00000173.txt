Officers of the Phalanx.
171
" The following is the copy of a letter which I addressed to a gentle¬
man of Philadelphia, and which you may find of interest:
'In conversation with you a few days since, I promised to elaborate
somewhat the ideas which I expressed with regard to the appointment
of officers of colored troops.
' Military men, whose opinion is worth having, will agree in this,
that to have good and efficient troops it is indispensable that we should
have good officers. The material for soldiers which the loyal States
have furnished during this rebellion, I have no hesitation in saying, is
the best that the world has ever seen. Such men deserve to have officers
to command them who have been educated to the military profession.
But few men are really fit to command men who have not had such an
education. In default of this, as a sufficient number of such men cannot
be found in the country, the number has to be made up from the best
available material. In order to ascertain whether or not the aspirant
possesses the proper knowledge and capacity for command, it is neces¬
sary that he be examined by a board of competent officers. The fact
that the life and death of the men of the regiment is intimately con¬
nected with the competency of its officers, is not sufficiently appreciated
by the community.
'The Board for the examination of officers of colored troops over
which I preside, considers three things as indispensable before recom¬
mending a candidate, viz.: A good moral character, physical capacity,
true loyalty to the country. A person possessing these indispensable
qualifications is now submitted to an examination as to his knowledge
of tactics and capacity for command.
' The following grades are entertained, viz.;
Colonel—1st, 2d and 3d Class. Lieut.-Colonel—1st, 2d and 3d Class.
Major— " Captain— "
1st Lieut.— " 2d Lieut.— "
and the recommendations for appointment made according to the appli¬
cant's merits.
' "We have endeavored, to the best of our abilitj, to make this rec¬
ommendation without partiality, favor or affection. We consider alone,
in making our awards, the ability of the person tp serve his country in.
the duties appertaining tp the office. If, in the opinion of the Board,
the person is not possessed of sufficient knowledge or capacity to fill
either of the above named to the advantage of his country, he is rejected,
notwithstanding any influence he may be able to bring to bear in the
case. Let it be remembered that zeal alone is not sufficient; but what we i
require for a good officer is zeal combined with knowledge. No ordinary
man can properly fill the office of colonel of a regiment. To acquire that
knowledge of tactics as would fit him to command his regiment, as it
ought to be in all situations, requires much study and practice, and is by
no means easy. He should, besides, possess good administrative quali¬
ties, in order that affairs should run smoothly in his command, and the
officers and privates be as contented and happy as circumstances admit.
