442 History of the Black Phalanx.
"During the forenoon of the 7th,the enemy attacked in force on the
right, driving in Kautz's cavalry and capturing Elder's battery of the
First United States Artillery, but was checked and driven back by the
First Division of the Tenth Corps. The regiment was moved to the
tight, and after changing positions several times, went into the trenches
near the New Market road.
" On the afternoon of the 12th, orders came for the regiment to be
ready to move in light marching order, and later it moved out about
half of a mile to the front and right, and deployed two companies as
skirmishers. Shortly after dark it was withdrawn to the position it
held earlier in the day. A cold rain was falling, and as the men were
without overcoats, they suffered considerably.
"About 3 o'clock on the morning of the 13th, our own division
(Third), together with the First, moved out of camp and marched to
the right until it reached the Darbytown road. Here it formed line, and
advancing through the thick undergrowth finally lay down in front of
the enemy's works to await developments. At 10 o'clock the First
Division, which, with the cavalry, had gone to the right, charged the
enemy's line, but failed to break it and had to withdraw with consider¬
able loss. About noon the regiment relieved the Eighth on the skirmish
line. Capt. Dickey, of the Eighth, was killed during the movement.
Here it remained until about 4 o'clock, when, the remainder of the divi¬
sion having been withdrawn, it fell back covering the movement of the
corps and returned to its old camp on the New Market road. * * *
"The regiment remained in camp until the 26th, furnishing in the
meantime a large picket detail, together with details for fatigue, em¬
ployed in the construction of earthworks, abattis, etc. On this date
Col. Voris was relieved from command of the brigade by Col. Shaw,
Lieut.-Col. Haskell taking command of the regiment.
" On the evening of this day orders were received for the regiment
to be ready to move on the following morning, with three days' cooked
rations, and in light marching order. At 5 a. m. we moved out of camp
and took the road toward the right. The Eighteenth, as well as our
own corps, was in motion. The orders were for the Tenth Corps to
threaten the enemy's line near the Darbytown road, while the Eighteenth
moving by the rear to the right, was to strike their left flank. If they
weakened their line in its front, the Tenth Corps was to advance. The
whole movement being made to cover the advance of the Army of the
Potomoc against the rebel lines covering Hatcher's run and the Boyd-
town plank-road.
"Marching about two miles to the right we struck the Darbytown
road, when line of battle was formed to the left, and moved forward
through the woods, and, in places, almost impassable undergrowth—the
Seventh having the left of the division as well of the line. Our ears
were soon greeted with the scattering fire of our skirmish line, inter*
spersed by the crashing of an occasional shell through the tree-tops.
After an advance of half a mile the division halted to await the result
