[Continuation of page 435 foot-note.]
Went down the hill across the marsh,—
Into the brook—there halted—ah! how harsh
The rebels' Are opened upon them, artillery-
Hail swept the run, and the infantry
Broke, the column wavered tho' not in dismay,
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
Again the shattered columns form and again advance
To firmer ground,tho' the redoubt hurl'd like an avalanchd
In quick succession, bursting bombs and canister shot,
But with closed ranks the column, fearing not
Unheedful of the iron hail bent its way,
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
Now the head of the column of fours go down
Under the murderous fire and the hissing song
Of the enemy's shells, now the axe men spring
To the abatis high and long, now their axes ring
Out on the morning air, they were swept away.
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
The flags are where, do they kiss the morning light,
Do they wave in the battle's gale, are their stars bright,
Illuuninining the path of the brave? riddled and torn,
"With the dead they lay. Soon again they shone,
In the first gleam of the rising-s>un's ray,
Following Butler to New Market heignts that day.
Upon the brigade each felt that all was placed,
Their race and country's future honored or disgraced.
Hence with Spartan courage they the charge renewed.
And in hot haste the Nation's enemy pursued,
And sweat and blood from pore and wound inveigh,
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
*Forward, forward!' rung the command, the flags ara
up again,
The axe-men grin, and with a shout go over the slain.
To a second line of abatis. The welkin's aglow.
The advancing brigade shouts, 'Remember Fort Pillow f
And with a will and spirit they clear the way,
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
Down the dismounted cavalrymen fall by ranks,
The Infantry an adamantine wall on the flanks,
Close up briskly on right and left receive
The enflading fire from the brazen crest, breathe
They not a word in complaint, freedom's impulse obey,
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
Now the black axe-men tear from the sod the huge logs
Which science and treason placed deep in the bogs,
Skill gave way to freedom's might in the dastardly fight.
And the black brigade, with capless rifles and starry light.
Go through the gap to the Rebel's hell in gallant array.
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
Volley after volley poured, cannon after cannon roared,
Like reapers in a field a thousand artillerists mowed
In the gap, the brigade's advancing flies of four,
Yet on through the flood of death still the brigade pour.
Their battle cry, Remember Fort Pillow, the enemy
dismay,
Following Butler to New Market heights th#t day.
Hark! above the raging carnage swells the shout,
•No quarter to Niggers,' with hope of a rout,
But the brigade was not deterred, they retaliate
The defiant yells, Remember Fort Pillow, the fate
Of its garrison how it fell, on through the fray,
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
On for the redoubt over the rampart they go,
Not a rifle was flred, not a shot at the foe,
By the weight of the column the redoubt is theirs,
And the enemy routed, the chivalry scattered everywhere.
Victorious shouts the empyrean ring in repay,
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
