strictly enjoined to—not 'shoot them on the spot,' as was the order of
General Dix, but to hang them on the first tree; and hang them quickly.
"With the subsequent history of our black troops the public is
already familiar. General Lorenzo Thomas, titular Adjutant-General of
our army, not being regarded as a very efficient officer for that place,
was permanently detailed on various services; now exchanging prisoners,
now discussing points of military law, now organizing black brigades
down the Mississippi and elsewhere. In fact, the main object seemed to
be to keep this Gen. Thomas—who must not be confounded with Gen.
George H. Thomas, one of the true heroes of our army,—away from the
Adjutant-General's office at "Washington, in order that Brigadier-Gen¬
eral E:W. Townsend—only a Colonel until quite recently—might perform
all the laborious and crushing duties of Adjutant-General-of our army,
while only signing himself and ranking as First Assistant Adjutant-Gen¬
eral. If there be an officer who has done noble service in the late war
while receiving no public credit for the same,—no newspaper puffs nor
public ovation,—that man is Brigadier-General E. W. Townsend, who
should long since have been made a major-general, to rank from the
first day of the rebellion.
"And now let us only add, as practical proof that the rebels, even
in their most rabid state, were not insensible to the force of proper "rea¬
sons," the following anecdote: Some officers of one our black regiments
—Colonel Higginson's, we believe—indiscreetly rode beyond our lines
around St. Augustine in pursuit of game, but whether feathered or
female this deponent sayeth not. Their guide proved to be a spy, who
had given notice of the intended expedition to the enemy, and the whole
party were soon surprised and captured. The next we heard of them,
they were confined in the condemned cells of one of the Florida State
prisons, and were to be "tried"—i. e., sentenced and executed—as 'hav¬
ing been engaged in inciting negro insurrection.'
"We had some wealthy young slave-holders belonging to the first
families of South Carolina in the custody of Lieutenant-Colonel J. F.
Hall—now Brigadier-General of this city, who was our Provost Marshal;
and it was on this basis Gen. Hunter resolved to operate. ' Release my
officers of black troops from your condemned cells at once, and notify
me of the fact. Until so notified, your first family prisoners in my
hands'—the names then given—' will receive precisely similar treatment.
For each of my officers hung, I will hang three of my prisoners who are
slave-holders.' This dose operated with instantaneous effect, and the
next letter received from our captured officers set forth that they were at
large on parole, and treated as well as they could wish to be in that
miserable country.
"We cannot better conclude this sketch, perhaps, than by givitig the
brief but pregnant verses in which our ex-orderly, Private Miles O'Reilly,
late of the Old Tenth Army Corps, gave his opinion on this subject.
They were first published in connection with the banquet given in New
York by Gen. T. F. Meagher and the officers of the Irish Brigade, to the
