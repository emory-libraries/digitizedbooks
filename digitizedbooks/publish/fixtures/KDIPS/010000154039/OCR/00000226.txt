224 History of the Black Phalanx.
attack upon them; the confederates at first formed no reg¬
ular line of battle, but rushed pell-mell on the scattered
federals, intending, doubtless, to annihilate them at once.
The Union men soon recovered their arms, but before they
got into line, their commander, Colonel Brooks, had been
killed, and Captain Ransey of Co. C, 60th Regiment, as¬
sumed command. The men of the Phalanx, though they
had had but a short time to rest from a long march, rallied
with the ardor of veterans, and fought with that despera-
ation that men display when they realize that the strug¬
gle is either victory or death. It was not a question of
numbers with them; it was one of existence, and the Pha¬
lanx resolved itself into a seeming column of iron to meet
the foe as it rushed over the bodies of their dead and
wounded with the rage of madmen.
The two field guns, skillfully handled by black ar¬
tillery-men, did good work, plowing huge furrows through
the assailants and throwing them into confusion at every
charge. Still the confederates, having finally organized
into line of battle, continued to charge after each repulse,
pouring a terrific fire upon the United States force at each
advance. It seemed as if the Phalanx must surrender; they
were outnumbered two to one, and every line officer was
dead or wounded. Sergeant Triplet was directing the lire
of Company C; the artillery sergeant was in command of
the field guns, and worked them well for two long hours.
The enemy's sharp-shooters stationed in the trees no
longer selected thejr victims, for one man of the Phalanx
was as conspicuous as another.
Yet another assault was made; firm stood the little
band of iron men, not flinching, not moving, though the
dead lay thick before them. The cannon belched out their
grape shot, the musketry rattled, and once more the
enemy fled back to the woods with ranks disordered.
Thus fronl six o'clock till noonday did the weary soldiers
hold their foes back. The situation became critical with
the Phalanx. Their ammunition was nearly exhausted; a
few more rounds and their bayonets would be their only
protection against a massacre; this fact however, did not
cool their determination.
