manded by Colonel T. J. Morgan, afterwards raised to
Brigadier-General. The gallant 14th Infantry was one of
its regiments, the field officers of which were Colonel,
Thomas J. Morgan, who had been promoted through vari¬
ous grades, from a 1st Lieutenancy in the 70th Indiana
Volunteer Infantry ; Lieutenant-Colonel, H.C. Corbin, who
had risen from a 1st Lieutenancy of the 79th 0. V. 1., and
Major N. J. Yail, who had served as an enlisted man in
the 19th Illinois Volunteers. All the officers passed a
rigid examination before the board of examiners ap¬
pointed by the War Department for that purpose.
General Morgan, bv request- furnishes the following
highly interesting and historical statement of his services
with the Phalanx Brigade:
"The American Civil "War of 1861-5 marks an epoch not only in the
history of the United States, but in that of democracy, and of civiliza¬
tion. Its issue has vitally affected the course of human progress. To
the student of history it ranks along with the conquests of Alexander;
the incursions of the Barbarians; the Crusades; the discovery of America
and the American Revolution. It settled the question of our National
unity with all the consequences attaching thereto. It exhibited in a very
striking manner the power of a free people to preserve their form of gov¬
ernment against its most dangerous foe, Civil War. It not only enfran¬
chised four millions of American slaves of African descent, but made
slavery forever impossible in the great Republic, and gave a new impulse
to the cause of human freedom. Its influence upon American slaves was
immediate and startlingly revolutionary, lifting them from the condition
of despised chattels, bought and sold like sheep ill the market, with no
rights which the white man was bound to respect,—to the exalted plane
of American citizenship; made them free men, the peers in every civil and
political right, of their late masters. Within about a decade after the
close of the war, negroes, lately slaves, were legislators, state officers,
members of Congress, and for a brief time one presided over the Senate
of the United States, where only a few years before, Toombs had boasted
that he would yet call the roll of his slaves in the shade of Bunker Hill.
"To-day slavery finds no advocate, and the colored race in America
is making steady progress in all the elements of civilization. The con¬
duct of the American slave during, and since the war, has wrought an
extraordinary change in public ^sentiment, regarding the capabilities of
the race.
"The manly qualities of the negro soldiers, evinced in camp, on the
march and in battle, won for them golden opinions, made their freedom
a necessity and their citizenship a certainty.
"Those of us who assisted in organizing, disciplining and leading
