In 1821, in the convention which revised the constitu¬
tion of New York, Mr. Clark, speaking in favor of allow¬
ing negroes to vote, said in the course of his remarks:
"My honorable colleague has told us, that, as the colored people are
not required to contribute to the protection or defence of the State, they
are not entitled to an equal participation in the privileges of its citizens.
But, Sir, whose fault is this ? Have they ever refused to do military
duty when called upon ? It is haughtily asked, Who will stand in the
ranks shoulder to shoulder with a negro? I answer, No one, in time of
peace; no one, when your musters and trainings are looked upon as mere
pastimes; no one, when your militia will shoulder their muskets and
march to their trainings with as much unconcern as they would go to a
sumptuous entertainment or a splendid ball. But, Sir, when the hour of
danger approaches, your white 'militia' are just as willing that the man
of color should be set up as a mark to be shot at by the enemy, as to be set
up themselves. In the War of the Revolution, these people helped to
fight your battles by land and by sea. Some of your States were glad to
turn out corps of colored men, and to stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with
them.
"In your late war, they contributed largely towards some of your
most splendid victories. On Lakes Erie and Champlain, where your
fleets triumped over a foe superior in numbers and engines of death,
they were manned, in a large proportion, with men of color. And, in
this very house, in the fall of 1814, a bill passed, receiving the approba¬
tion of all the branches of your government, authorizing the Governor
to accept the services of a corps of two thousand free people of color.
Sir, these were times which tried men's souls. In these times it was no
sporting matter to bear arms. These were times, when a man who
shouldered his musket did not know but he barred his bosom to receive
a death wound from the enemy ere he laid it aside; and in these times,
these people were found as ready and as willing to volunteer in your ser¬
vice as any other. They were not compelled to go; they were not drafted.
No, your pride had placed them beyond your compulsory power. But
there was no necessity for its exercise; they were volunteers; yes, Sir,
