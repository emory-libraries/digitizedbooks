324: History of the Black Phalanx.
the West hospital, in Baltimore, have been under the kindest and most
intelligent treatment for about three weeks past, and many of them foi
a greater length of time, still they present literally the appearance o:
living skeletons, many of them being nothing but skin and bone; som<
of them are maimed for life, having been frozen while exposed to the in
clemency of the winter season on Belle Isle, being compelled to lie on th<
bare ground, without tents or blankets, some of them without overcoat!
or even coats, with but little fire to mitigate the severity of the windf
and storms to which they were exposed.
" The testimony shows that the general practice of their captors wai
to rob them, as soon as they were taken prisoners, of all their money
valuables, blankets, and good clothing, for which they received nothing
in exchange except, perhaps, some old worn-out rebel clothing hardly
better than none at all. Upon their arrival at Richmond they have beei
confined, without blankets or other covering, in buildings without fire
or upon Belle Isle with, in many cases, no shelter, and in others witl
nothing but old discarded army tents, so injured by rents and holes ai
to present but little barrier to the wind and storms; on several occasions
the witnesses say, they have arisen in the morning from their resting
places upon the bare earth, and found several of their comrades frozei
to death during the night, and that many others would have met th
same fate had they not walked rapidly back and forth, during the hour
which should have been devoted to sleep, for the purpose of retaining
sufficient warmth to preserve life.
"In respect to the food furnished to our men by the rebel authorities
the testimony proves that the ration Of each man was totally insufficien
in quantity to preserve the health of a child, even had it been of prope
quality, which it was not. It consisted usually, at the most, of tw<
small pieces of corn-bread, made in many instances, as the witnesse
state, of corn and cobs ground together, and badly prepared and cooked
of, at times, about two ounces of meat, usually of poor quality, and ur
Ht to be eaten, and occasionally a few black worm-eaten beans, or some
thing of that kind. Many of your men were compelled to sell to thei
guards, and others, for what price they could get, such clothing an
blankets as they were permitted to receive of that forwarded for thei
use by our government, in order to obtain additional food sufficient t
sustain life; thus,' by endeavoring to avoid one privation reducing then
selves to the same destitute condition in respect to clothing and covei
ing that they were in before they received any from our governmen
When they became sick and diseased in consequence of this exposure an
privation, and were admitted into the hospitals, their treatment ws
little if any, improved as to food, though they, doubtless, suffered lef
from exposure to cold than before. Their food still remained insufficier
in quantity and altogether unfit in quality. Their diseases and wounc
did not receive the treatment which the commonest dictates of hi
inanity would have prompted. One witness, whom your committee ei
amined, who had lost all the toes of one foot from being frozen while o
