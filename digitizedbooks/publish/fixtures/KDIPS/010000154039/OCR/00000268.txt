History of the Black Phalanx.
of the gunboat Norwich:
"40th Massachusetts Mounted Infantry, Col. Guy V. Henry.
"7th Connecticut, Col. J. R. Hawley.
" 7th New Hampshire, Col. Abbott.
"47th, 48th and 115th New York, Col. Barton's command.
"The Phalanx regiments were: 8th Pennsylvania, Col. Fribley; 1st
North Carolina, Lt.-Col. Reed; 54th Massachusetts, Col. Hallowell; 2d
South Carolina, Col. Eeecher; 55th Massachusetts, Col. Hartwell, with
three batteries of white troops, Hamilton's, Elder's and Langdon's.
Excepting the jtwo last named regiments, this force landed at J ackson-
ville on the 7th of February, and pushed on, following the 40th Massa¬
chusetts Mounted Infantry, which captured by a bold dash Camp Finni-
gan, about seven miles from Jacksonville, with its equipage, eight pieces
of artillery, and a number of prisoners. On the 10th, the whole force
had reached Baldwin, a railroad station twenty miles west of Jackson¬
ville. There the army encamped, except Col. Henry's force, which con¬
tinued its advance towards Tallahassee, driving a small force of Gen.
Finnegan's command before him. This was at the time all the rebel
force in east Florida. On the 18th Gen. Seymour, induced by the suc¬
cessful advance of Col. Henry, lead his troops from Baldwin with ten
days' rations in their haversacks, and started for the Suwanee river,
about a hundred and thirty miles from Baldwin station, leaving the 2d
South Carolina and the 55th Massachusetts Phalanx regiments to fol¬
low. After a fatiguing march the column, numbering about six thou¬
sand, reached Barbour's Station, on the Florida Central Railroad,
twenty miles from Baldwin. Here the command halted and bivouaced,
the night of the 19th, in the woods bordering upon a wooded ravine run¬
ning off towards the river from the railroad track.
" It is now nineteen years ago, and I write from memory of a night
long to be remembered. Around many a Grand Army Camp-fire in the
last fifteen years this bivouac has been made the topic of an evening's
talk. It was attended with no particular hardship. The weather was
such as is met with in these latitudes, not cold, not hot, and though a
thick vapory cloud hid the full round moon from early eventide until the
last regiment filed into the woods, yet there was a halo of light that
brightened the white, sandy earth and gave to the moss-laden limbs of
the huge pines which stood sentry-like on the roadside the appearance of
a New England grove on a frosty night, with a shelled road leading
through it.
"It was.well in the night when the two Phalanx regiments filed out
of the road into the woods, bringing up the rear of the army, and took
shelter under the trees from the falling dew. Amid the appalling stillness
that reigned throughout the encampment, except the tramp of feet and
an occasional whickering of a battery horse, no sound broke the deep
silence. Commands were given in an undertone and whispered along the
long lines of weary troops that lay among the trees and the underbrush
of the pine forest. Each soldier lay with his musket beside him, ready tQ
