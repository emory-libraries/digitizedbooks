Histoky of the Black Phalanx.
den, Arkansas on the 11th instant with 695 men and two guns, with a forage train of
198 wagons.
'I proceeded westerly on the Washington road a distance of eighteen miles, where I
halted the train and dispatched part of it in different directions to load; one hundred
wagons with a large part of the command, under Major Ward, being sent six miles
beyond the camp. These wagons returned to camp at midnight, nearly all loa>ded with
corn.
' At sunrise on the 18th, the command started on the return, loading the balance of
the train as it proceeded, there being but a few wagon loads of corn to be found at any
one place. I was obliged to detail portions of the command in different directions to-
load the wagons, until nearly all of my available force was so employed.
' At a point known as Cross Roads, four miles west of my camping ground, I was
met by a re-enforcement of three hundred and seventy-flve men of the 18th Iowa Infan¬
try, commanded by Capt. Duncan, twenty-five men of the 6th Kansas, Lieut. Phillip®
commanding, forty-five men of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry, Lieut. Boss commanding,
twenty men of the 14th Kansas Cavalry, Lieut. Smith commanding, and two mountain
howitzers from the 6th Kansas Cavalry, Lieut. Walker commanding,—in all, 465 men
and two mountain howitzers. These, added to my former command, made my entire
force consist of eight hundred and seventy-five, two hundred and eighty-five cavalry,
and four guns. But the excessive fatigue of the preceeding day, coming as it did at the.
close of a toilsome march of twenty-four hours without halting, had so affected the in¬
fantry that fully one hundred of the 1st Kansas Colored were rendered unfit for duty.
Many of the cavalry had, in violation of orders, straggled from their command, so
that at this time my effective force did not exceed one thousand men.
4 At a point one mile east of this, my advance came upon a picket of the enemy,
which was driven back one mile, when a line of the enemy's skirmishers presented itself.
Here I halted the train, formed a line of the small force I then had in advance, and
ordered that portion of the 1st Kansas Colored which had previously been guarding
the rear of the train to the front, and gave orders for the train to be packed'as closely
as the nature of the ground would permit. I also opened a fire upon the enemy's lin&
from the section of the 2nd Indiana Battery, for the double purpose pf ascertaining if
possible if the enemy had artillery in position in front, and also to draw in some forag¬
ing parties which had previously been dispatched upon either flank of the train. No
response was elicited save a brisk fire from the enemy's skirmishers.
' Meanwhile, the remainder of the first Kansas Colored had come to the front, as
also three detachments, which formed part of the original escort, which I formed in
line facing to the front, with a detachment of the 14th Kansas Cavalry, on my right,
and detachments of the 2nd and 6th Kansas Cavalry on the left flank. I also sent
orders to Capt. Duncan, commanding the ISth Iowa Infantry, to so dispose of his regi¬
ment and the cavalry and howitzers which came out with him as to protect the rear of
the train, and to keep a sharp lookout for a movement upon his rear and right flank.
' Meanwhile a movement of the enemy's infantry toward my right flank had been,
observed through the thick brush which covered the face of the country in that direc¬
tion. Seeing this, I ordered forward the [cavalry on my right, under Lieuts. Mitchell
and Henderson, with orders to press the enemy's line, force it if possible, and at all
events to ascertain his position and strength, fearing as I did that the silence of the1
enemy in front was but for the purpose of drawing me on to the open ground which lay
ih my front. At this juncture, a rebel rode into my lines and inquired for Col. DeMorse.
From him I learned that General Price was in command of the rebel force, and that
Col. DeMorse was in command of the force on my right.
• The cavalry had advanced but four hundred yards, when a brisk fire of musketry
was opened upon them from the brush, which they returned with true gallantry, but
were forced to fall back. In this skirmish many of the cavalry were unhorsed, and
Lieut. Henderson, of the 6th Kansas Cavalry, fell, wounded in the abdomen, while-
bravely and gallantly urging his command forward.
•In the meantime I formed five companies of the 1st Kansas Colored, with one
piece of artillery, on my right flank, and ordered up to their assistance four companies
of the 18th Iowa Infantry. Soon my orderly returned from the rear with a message-
from Captain Duncan, stating that he was so closely pressed in the rear by the enemy's,
infantry and artillery that the men could not be spared.
' At this moment the enemy opened on me with two batteries,—one of six pieces, in
front, and one, of three pieces, on my right flank,—pouring in an incessant and well
directed cross-fire of shot and shell. At the same time he advanced his infantry both
in front and on my right flank.
•From the force of the enemy—now the first time made visible—I saw that 1 could
not hope to defeat him, but still resolved to defend the train to the last, hoping that re-
enforcements would come up from Camden.
' I suffered them to approach within one hundred yards of my line, when I opened
upon them with musketry charged with buck and ball, and after a contest of fifteen
minutes duration compelled them them to fall back. Two fresh regiments coming up,
they again rallied and advanced upon my line, this time with colors flying and continu¬
ous cheering, so loud as to drown even the roar of the musketry. Again I suffered
them to approach even nearer than before, and opened upon them with buck and ball,
their artillery still pouring in a crossfire of shot and shell over the heads of their in¬
fantry, and mine replying with vigor and effect. And thus, for another quarter of an
hour, the battle was waged with desperate fury. The noise and din of this almost
hand to hand conflict was the loudest and most terrific it has ever been my lot to listen
