History of the Black Phalanx.
ancestry, Africa, and he abjured their religion. In the
South he had no family; women were merely the tempor¬
ary sharer of his pleasures; his master's cabins were the
homes of his children during their childhood. While the
Indian perished in the struggle for the preservation of his
home, his hunting grounds and his freedom, the negro
entered into slavery as soon as he was born, in fact was
often purchased in the womb, and was born to know, first,
that he was a slave. If one became free, he found freedom
harder to bear than slavery; half civilized, deprived of
nearly all rights, in contact with his superiors in wealth
and knowledge, exposed to the rigor of a tyrannical prej¬
udice moulded into laws, he contented himself to be
allowed to live.
The Negro race, however, it must be remembered, is

that inhabited the United States, to a new race,—the Am¬
erican Negro. Professor Sampson in his mixed races says:
" The Negro is a new race, and is not the direct descent of any people
that have ever flourished. The glory of the negro race is yet to come."
As evidence of its capacity to acquire glory, the record
made in the late struggle furnishes abundant proof. At
the sound of the tocsin at the North, negro' waiter, cook,
barber, boot-black, groom, porter and- laborer stood
ready at the enlisting office; and though the recruiting
officer refused to list his name, he waited like the "patient
