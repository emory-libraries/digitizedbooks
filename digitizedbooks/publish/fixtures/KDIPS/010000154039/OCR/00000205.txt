charging at double quick time, but the Phalanx held its
fire until the enemy was close upon them, and then poured
a deadly volley into the ranks of the exultant foe, stop¬
ping them short and mowing them down like grass. The
confederates recoiled, and now began a fight such as was
always fought when the Southerners became aware that
black soldiers were in front of them, and for an hour and a
half they fought at close quarters, ceasing only at night.
Every charge of the enemy was repulsed by the steady gal¬
lantry of General Emory's brigade and the black Phalanx,
who saved the army from annihilation against a foe num¬
bering three to one. During this memorable campaign the
Phalanx more than once met the enemy and accepted the
face of their black flag declarations. The confederates
knew full well that every man of the Phalanx would fight

ments, the 1st Mississippi and a small detachment of white
cavalry, in all about 1,400 men, raw recruits. General
Dennis looking upon the place more as a station for
organizing and drilling the Phalanx, had made no partic,-
ular arrangements in anticipation of an attack. He was
surprised, therefore, when a force of 3,000 men, under
General Henry McCulloch, from the interior of Louisiana,
attacked and drove his pickets and two companies of the
23d Iowa Cavalry, (white) up to the breastworks of the
Bend. The movement was successful, however, and the
confederates, holding the ground, rested for the night, with
the expectation of marching into the fortifications in the
morning, to begin a massacre, wThether a resistance should
