" Washington, May 21st, 1865.
"Maj. Gen. F. Steele, Commanding Rio Grande Expedition.
"By assignment of the President, Gen. Sheridan takes general com¬
mand west of the Arkansas. It is the intention to prosecute a vigorous
campaign in that country, until the whole of Texas is re-occupied by
people acknowledging allegiance to the Government of the United
States. Sheridan will probably act offensively from the Red river. But
it is highly important that we should have a strong foothold upon the
Rio Grande, You have been selected to take that part of the command.
In addition to the force you take from Mobile Bay, you will have the
25th Corps and the few troops already in Southern Texas.
" Any directions you may receive from Gen. Sheridan, you will obey.
But in the absence of instructions from him you will proceed without
delay to the mouth of the Rio Grande and occupy as high up that river
as your force and means of supplying will admit of.
" Your landing will probably have to be made at Brazos, but you
will learn more fully upon that matter on your arrival. We will have
to observe a strict neutrality towards Mexico, in the French and Eng¬
lish sense of the word. Your own good sense and knowledge of inter¬
national law, and experience of policy pursued towards us in this war
teaches you what will be proper.
