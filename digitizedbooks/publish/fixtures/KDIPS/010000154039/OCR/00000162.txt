own consideration. For us, onr profession makes the sacrifice of life a contingency
ever present and always to be accepted; and although such a form of death as your
order proposes, is not that to the contemplating of which soldiers have trained them¬
selves, I feel well assured, both for myself and those included in my sentence, that we-
could die in no manner more damaging to your abominable rebellion and the abomina¬
ble institution which is its origin.
" The South has already tried one hanging experiment, but not with a success one
would think—to encourage its repetition. John Brown, who was well known to me in
Kansas, and who will be known in appreciative history through centuries which will
only recall your name to load it with curses, once entered Virginia with seventeen men
and an idea. The terror caused by the presence of his idea, and the dauntless courage*
which prompted the assertion of his faith, against all odds, I need not now recall.
The history is too familiar and too painful. ' Old Ossawatomie' was caught and hung;
his seventeen men were killed, captured or dispersed, and several of them shared his
fate. Portions of his skin were tanned, I am told, and circulated as relics dear to the-
barbarity of the slave-holding heart. But more than a million of armed white men,
Mr. Davis, are to-day marching South, in practical acknowledgement that they regard
the hanging of three years ago as the murder of a martyr; and as they march to a
battle which has the emancipation of all slaves as one of its most glorious results, Ms-
name is on their lips; to the music of his memory their marching feet keep time; and as-
they sling knapsacks each one becomes aware that he is an armed apostle of the faith-
preached by him,
"' Who has gone to be a soldier
In the army of the Lord!'
" I am content, if such be the will of Providence to ascend the scaffold made saered
by the blood of this martyr; and I rejoice at .every prospect of making our struggle-
more earnest and inexorable on both sides; for the sharper the conflict the sooner
ended; the more vigorous and remorseless the strife, the less blood must be shed in it
eventually.
"In conclusion, let me assure you, that I rejoice with my whole heart that your
order in my case, and that of my officers, if unrevoked, will untie our hands for the
future; and that we shall be able to treat rebellion as it deserves, and give to the felony
of treason a felon's death.
" Very obediently yours,
DAVID HUNTER, MaJ.-Gen."
"Not long after General Hunter's return to the Department of the-
South, the first step towards organizing and recognizing negro troops-
was taken by our Government, in a letter of instructions directing Brig¬
adier-General Rufus Saxton—then Military Governor of South Carolina,
Georgia and Florida, within the limits of Gen. Hunter's command—to-
forthwith raise and organize fifty thousand able-bodied blacks, for ser¬
vice as laborers in the quartermaster's department; of whom five thou¬
sand—only five thousand, mark you—might be armed and drilled as sol¬
diers for the purpose of' protecting the women and children of their
fellow-laborers who might be absent from home in the public service.'
" Here was authority given to Gen. Saxton, over Hunter's head to
pursue some steps farther the experiment which Hunter—soon followed
by General Phelps, also included in the rebel order of 'outlawry' had
been the first to initiate. The rebel order still remained in full force and
with no protest against it on the part of our Government; nor to our
knowledge, was any demand from Washington ever made for its revoca¬
tion during the existence of the Confederacy. If Hunter, therefore or
any of his officers, had been captured in any of the campaigns of the-
past two and a half years, they had the pleasant knowledge for their
comfort that any rebel officers into whose hands they might fall, was
