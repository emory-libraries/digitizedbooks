History of the Black Phalanx
'i visited the scene of this engagement the morning after its occurrence, and for
the first time beheld the horrible evidences of the demoniac spirit of these rebel fiends
in their treatment of our dead and wounded. Men were found with their brains beatep
out with clubs, and the bloody weapons left by their sides and their bodies most horri¬
bly mutilated.'
"It was afterwards ascertained that the force who attacked this for¬
aging party consisted partially of citizens of the neighborhood, who,
while enjoying the protection of our armies, had collected together to
assist the rebel forces in this attack. Colonel Williams directed that the
region of country within a radius of five miles from the scene of conflict
should be devastated, and is of opinion that this effectually prevented a
like occurrence in the same neighborhood.
" Subsequently, while on this expedition, the command captured a pris¬
oner in arms who had upon his person the evidence of having been pa¬
roled by the commanding officer at Fort Scott, Kansas, he was shot
on the spot.
" The regiment remained in camp at Baxter Springs until the 27th of
J une, 1863, when it struck tents and marched for Fort Gibson in connec¬
tion with a large supply train from Fort Scott en route to the former
place.
Colonel "Williams had received information that satisfied him that
the train would be attacked in the neighborhood of Cabin Creek, Chero¬
kee Nation. He communicated this information to Lieutenant-Colonel
Dodd, of the 2nd Colorado Infantry, who was in command of the escort,
and volunteered to move his regiment in such manner as would be ser¬
viceable in case the expected attack should be made. The escort proper
to the train consisted of six companies of the 2nd Colorado Infantry, a
detachment of three companies of cavalry from the 6th and 9th Kansas,
and one section of the 2nd Kansas Battery. This force was joined, on
the 28t>h of June, by three hundred men from the Indian Brigade, com¬
manded by Major Foreman, making altogether a force of about eight
hundred effective men.
"On arriving at Cabin Creek, July 1st, 1863, the rebels were met in
force—under command of Gen. Cooper. Some skirmishing occurred on
that day, when it was ascertained that the enemy occupied a strong po¬
sition on the south bank of the creek, and upon trial it was found that
the stream was not fordable for infantry, on account of a recent shower.
but it was supposed that the swollen current would have sufficiently sub¬
sided by the next morning to allow the infantry to cross. The regiment
then took a strong position on the north side of the stream and camped
for the night. After a consultation of officers, it was agreed that the
train should be parked in the open prairie and guarded by three com¬
panies of the 2nd Colorado and a detachment of one hundred men of the
1st Colorado, and that the balance of the troops, Col. Williams com¬
manding, should engage the enemy and drive him from his position.
"Accordingly, the next morning, July 2nd, 1863, the command
moved, which consisted of the 1st Kansas Volunteer Colored Infantry,
three companies of the 2nd Colorado Infantry, commanded by the gal-
