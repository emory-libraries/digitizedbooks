their representatives. For the right of free negroes to bear arras in the
public defense was, at that day, as little disputed in New England as
other rights. They took their place, not in a seperate corps, but in the
ranks with the white men; and their names may be seen on the pension-
rolls of the country, side by side with those of other soldiers of the
Kevolution."
It was not the free only who took up arms in defence
of America's independence; not alone those who, in pre¬
ceding wars,—Indian and French,—had gained their lib¬
erty, that swelled the ranks of the colonial militia; but
slaves, inspired by the hope of freedom, went to the
front, as Attucks had done when he cut the Gordian knot
that held the colonies to Great Britain. "From that
moment we may date the severance of the British Em¬
pire," said Daniel Webster, in his Bunker Hill oration,
referring to the massacre on the 5th of March, 1770. The
thirst for freedom was universal among the people of New
England. With them liberty was not circumscribed by con¬
dition and now, since the slave Attucks had struck the
first blow for America's independence, thereby electrifying
the colonies and putting quite a different phase upon their
grievances, the people were called upon to witness a real
slave struggling with his oppressors for his freedom. It
touched the people of the colonies as they had never been
touched before, and they arrayed themselves for true
freedom.
Dr. Joseph Warren thus heralds the sentiment of the
colonist, in his oration delivered at Boston, March
5th, 1775:
" That personal freedom is the natural right of every man, and that
property, or an exclusive right to dispose of what he has honestly
acquired by his own labor, necessarily arises therefrom, are truths
which common sense has placed beyond the reach of contradiction. And
no man, or body of men, can, without being guilty of flagrant injustice,
claim a right to dispose of the persons or acquisitions of any other man
or body of men, unless it can be proved that such a right has arisen
from some compact between the parties, in which it has been explicitly
and freely granted."
The year previous, John Hancock was the orator on
the occasion of the 4th anniversary of the shedding of
