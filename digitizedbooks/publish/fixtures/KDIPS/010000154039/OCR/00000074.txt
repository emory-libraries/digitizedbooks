CHAPTER II.
THE WAR OF 1812.
While there is no intention of entering into an exam¬
ination of the causes of the war between the United States
and Great Britain in 1812, yet in order to carry out the
design of the author to show that in this war,—like all
others in which the government of the United States
has been engaged,—the negro, as a soldier, took part, it
is deemed necessary to cite at least one of the incidents,
perhaps the incident, which most fired the national heart
of America, and hastened the beginning of hostilities.
The war between England and France gave to the
American merchant marine interest an impetus that in¬
creased the number of vessels three-fold in a few years;
it also gave command of the carrying trade of the West
Indies, from which Napoleon's frigates debarred the Eng¬
lish merchantmen. In consequence England sought and
used every opportunity to cripple American commerce
and shipping. One plan was to deprive American ships of
the service of English seamen. Her war vessels claimed
and exercised the right of searching for English seamen
on board American vessels. During the year 1807, the
English Admiral Berkeley, in command of the North
American Station, issued instructions to commanders of
vessels in his fleet to look out for the American frigate
Chesapeake, and if they fell in with her at sea, to board
her and search for deserters, as all English seamen in the
American service were regarded by England. With the
instructions, were the descriptions of four sailors, three
negroes and one white man, who were missing.
