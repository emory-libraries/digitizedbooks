402 History of the Black Phalanx.
"No worse strain on the nerves of troops is possible, for it is harder
to remain quiet under cannon fire, even though comparatively harm¬
less, than to advance against a storm of musketry."
General W. F. Smith, though brave, was too cautious
and particular in detail, and he spent those four hours in
careful reconnoissance, while the troops lay exposed to
the enemy's concentric fire.
The main road leading east from Petersburg ascends a
hill two or more miles out, upon the top of which stood
what was then known as Mr. Dunn's house. In front of
it was a fort, and another south, and a third north, with
other works; heavy embankments and deep ravines and
ditches, trunks of hewn trees blackened by camp fires,
formed an abatis on the even ground. Here the sharp¬
shooters and riflemen had a fair view of the entire field.
The distance from these works to the woods was about

waiting for the command, "forward." The forts near
Dunn's house had direct front fire, and those on the north
an enfilading fire on the line of advance. Smith got his
troops in line for battle by one o'clock, but there they lay.
Hinks impatiently awaited orders; oh! what a suspense—
each hour seemed a day,—what endurance—what valor.
Shells from the batteries ploughed into the earth where
they stood, and began making trouble for the troops.
Hinks gave the order, " lie down;" they obeyed, and were
somewhat sheltered. Five o'clock—yet no orders. At
length the command was given, "forward." The skir¬
mishers started at quick time; the enemy opened upon
them vigorously from their batteries and breastworks,
upon which they rested their muskets, in order to fire
with accuracy. A torrent of bullets was poured upon the
advancing line, and the men fell fast as autumn leaves in
a gale of wind. Then the whole line advanced, the Pha¬
lanx going at double-quick; their well aligned ranks, with
bayonets glittering obliquely in the receding sunlight,
presented a spectacle both magnificent and grand.
Duncan rushed his skirmishers and reached the ditches
in front of the breastworks, which, without waiting for
