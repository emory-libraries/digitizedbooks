History of the Black Phalanx.
the beach, and the rebels trained their recovered cannon anew upon th»
retreating survivors. -
"What a fearful night was that, as we gathered up our wounded
heroes, and bore them to a place of shelter! And what a mournful
morning, as the sun rose with his clear beams, and revealed our terrible
losses! What a rich harvest Death had gathered to himself during th®
short struggle! Nearly two thousand of our men had fallen. More than
six hundred of our brave boys lay dead on the ramparts of the fatal
fort, in its broad ditch, and along the beach at its base. A flag of truc«
party went out to bury our dead, but General Beauregard they found had
already buried them, where they fell, in broad, deep trenches."
Colonel Shaw, the young and gallant commander of
the 54th Regiment, was formerly a member of the famous
7th N. Y. Regiment. He was of high, social and influen¬
tial standing, and in his death won destinction. The con¬
federates added to his fame and glory, though uninten¬
tionally, by burying him with his soldiers, or as a confed¬
erate Major expressed the information, when a request for
the Colonel's body was made, "we have buried him with
his niggers!"
A poet has immortalized the occurrence and the gal¬
lant Shaw thus:
4 They buried him with his niters I' «They buried him with his niggers I'
Together they fought and died. A wide grave should it be;
There was room for them all where they They buried more in that shallow trencb
laid him, Than human eye could see.
(The grave was deep and wide), Aye, all the shames and sorrows
For his beauty and youth and valor, Of more than a hundred years
Their patience and love and pain; Lie under the weight of that Southern
And at the last together soil
They shall be found again. Despite those cruel sneers.
• They buried him with his niggers!' ' They buried him with hiR niggers I'
Earth holds no prouder grave; But the glorious souls set free
There is not a mausoleum , Are leading the van of the army
In the world beyond the wave, That fights for liberty.
That a nobler tale has hallowed, Brothers in death, in glory
Or a purer glory crowned, The same palm branches bear;
Than the nameless trench where they And the crown is as bright o'er the sabl*
buried brows
The brave so faithful found. As over the golden hair.
Buried with a band of brothers
Who for him would fain have died;
Buried with tte gallant fellows
Who fell fighting by his side;
Buried with the men God gave him,
Those whom he was sent to save;
Buried with the martyr heroes,
He has found an honored grave.
Buried where his dust so precious
Makes the soil a hallowed spot;
Buried where by Christian patriot,
He shall never be forgot.
Buried in the ground accursed,
Which man's fettered feet have trod;
Buried where his voice still speaketh.
Appealing for the slave to God;
Fare thee well, thou noble warrior.
Who in youthful beauty went
On a high and holy mission,
By the God of battles sent.
Chosen of him, 'elect and precious,'
Well didst thpu fulfil thy part;
When thy country 'counts her jewels,*
She shall wear thee on her heart."
