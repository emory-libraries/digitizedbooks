The Army of the Frontier.

federate force of about five hundred, commanded by Colonel Cockrell,
but after a severe engagement the enemy was defeated with considerable
Iohh. The negro loss was ten killed and twelve wounded, including Cap¬
tain A. J. Crew, a gallant young officer, being among the first mentioned.
The next morning the command was re-enforced bv a few recruits under
command of Captain J. M. Williams, when the enemy was pursued a con¬
siderable distance but without further fighting. This is supposed to
have been the first engagement in the war in which colored troops were
actually engaged. The work of recruiting, drilling and disciplining the
regiment was continued under the adverse circumstances until the 13th
of January, 1863, when a battallion of six companies, formed by the
consolidation of Colonel "Williams' recruits with those of Captaiil Sea¬
man, was mustered into the U. S. service by Lieutenant Sabin, of the
regular army. Between January 13th and May 2nd, 1863. the other
four companies were organized, when the regimental organization was
completed, appears by the roster of the regiment.
"Immediately after its organization, the regiment was ordered to
Baxter Springs, where it arrived in May, 1863, and the work of drilling
the regiment was vigorously prosecuted.
" Parts of two companies of the regiment, and a detachment of cav¬
alry, and one piece of artillery, made a diversion on Shawnee, Mo. at¬
tacked and dispersed a small opposing force and captured five prisoners.
"While encamped here, on the 18th of May, a foraging party, con¬
sisting of twenty-five men from the Phalanx regiment and twenty men
of the 2nd Kansas Battery, Major E. G. Ward commanding, was sent
into Jasper County, Mo. This party was surprised and attacked by a
force of three hundred confederates commanded by Major Livingston,
and defeated, with a loss of sixteen killed and five prisoners, three of
which belonged to the 2nd Kansas Battery and two of the black regi¬
ment. The men of the 2nd Kansas Battery were afterwards exchanged
under a flag of truce for a like number of prisoners captured by the negro
regiment. Livingston refused to exchange the black prisoners in his
possession, and gave as his excuse "that he should hold them subject to
the orders of the confederate War Department. Shortly after this Col.
Williams received information that one of the prisoners held by Living¬
ston had been murdered by the enemy. He immediately sent a flag o{
truce to Livingston demanding the body of the person who committed
the barbarous act. ^Receiving an evasive and unsatisfactory teply, Col.
Williams determined to convince the Major that was a game at which
two could play, and directed that one of the prisoners in his possession
be shot, and within thirty minutes the order was executed. He immedi¬
ately informed Major Livingston of his action, sending the information
by the same party that brought the despatch to him. Suffice it to say
that this ended the barbarous practice of murdering prisoners of war, so
far as Livingston's command was concerned.
