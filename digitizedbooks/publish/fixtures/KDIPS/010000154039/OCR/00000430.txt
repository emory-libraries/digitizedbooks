428 History of the Black Phalanx.
"In regard to the bravery of the colored troops, although I have
been in upwards of twenty battles, I never saw so many cases of gal¬
lantry. The 'crater,' where we were halted, was a perfect slaughter-pen.
Had not 'some one blundered,' but moved us up at daylight, instead of
eight o'clock, we should have been crowned with success, instead of be¬
ing cut to pieces by a terrific enfilading fire, and finally forced from the
field in a panic. We had no trouble in rallying the troops and moving
them into the rifle-pits; and, in one hour after the rout I had nearly as
many men together as were left unhurt.
" I was never under such a terrific fire, and can hardly realize how
any escaped alive. Our loss was heavy. Jn the Twenty-eighth (colored)
for instance, commanded by Lieut.-Col. Russell (a Bostonian), he lost
seven officers out of eleven, and ninety-one men out of two hundred and
twenty-four; and the colonel himself was knocked over senseless, for a
few minutes, by a slight wound in the head; both his color-sergeants
and all his color-guard were killed. Col. Bross, of the Twenty-ninth,
was killed outright, and nearly every one of his officers hit. This was
nearly equal to Bunker Hill. Col. Ross, of the Thirty-first, lost his leg.
The Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth (colored), all charged
over the works; climbing up an earthwork six feet high, then down into
a ditch, and up on the other side, all the time under the severest fire in
front and flank. Not being supported, of course the storming party
fell back. I have seen white troops run faster than these blacks did,
when in not halt so tight a place. Our brigade lost thirty-six prisoners,
all cut off after leaving the ' crater.' My faith in colored troops is not
abated one jot.'"
The Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the
War investigated the affair, before which General Grant
testified. He was severe upon General Ledlie, whom he
regarded as an inefficient officer; he blamed himself for
allowing that officer to lead the assault. General Grant
also testified:
'■General Burnside wanted to put his colored division in front; I
believe if he had done so it would have been a success."
On the morning of the 13th of August, 1864, a bri¬
gade of the Phalanx, consisting of the 7th, 8th, 9 ch and
29th Regiments, crossed from Bermuda Hundreds to the
north side of the James river, on pontoons, near Jones'
landing, and bivouacked for the night. General Grant
was led to believe that General Lee had sent a portion of
his troops, at least three divisions of infantry, and one of
cavalry, from the front of Petersburg, to re-enforce Gen.
Early, then operating in the valley. Consequently he
