History of the Black Phalanx.
"Among the brave blacks who fought in the battles for American
liberty was Major Jeffrey, a Tennesseean, who, during the campaign of
Major-General Andrew Jackson in Mobile, filled the place of "regular"
among the soldiers. In the charge made by General Stump against the
enemy, the Americans were repulsed and thrown into disorder,—Major
Stump being forced to retire, in a manner by no means desirable, under
the circumstances. Major Jeffrey, who was but a common soldier, see¬
ing the condition of his comrades, and comprehending the disastrous"
results about to befall them, rushed forward, mounted a horse, took
command of the troops, and, by an heroic effort, rallied them to the-
charge,—completely routing the enemy, who left the Americans masters
of the field. He at once received from the General the title of "Major,""
though he could 'not, according to the American policy, so commission
Mm. To the day of his death, he was known by that title in Nashville,,
where he resided, and the circumstances which entitled him to it were-
constantly the subject of popular conversation.
Major Jeffrey was highly respected by the whites generally, and
revered, in his own neighborhood, by all the colored people who knew
him.
A few years ago receiving an indignity from a common ruffian, he was
forced to strike him in self-defense; for which act, in accordance with the
laws of slavery in that, as well as many other of the slave States, he
was compelled to receive, on his naked person, nine and thirty lashes
with a raw hide! This, at the age of seventy odd, after the distinguished
services rendered his country,—probably when the white ruffian for whom
he was tortured was unable to raise an arm in its defense,—was more
than he could bear; it broke his heart, and he sank to rise no more, till
summoned by the blast of the last trumpet to stand on the battle-field
of the general resurrection."
Jeffrey was not an exception to this kind of treatment.
Samuel Lee died on a tobacco plantation after the war.
The re-enslaving of the negroes who fought for Ameri¬
can Independence became so general at the South, that
the Legislature of Virginia in 1783, in compliance with
her honor, passed an act directing the emancipation of
certain slaves, who had served as soldiers of the State,,
and for the emancipation of the slave Aberdeen.
James Armistead during the war acted as a scout and
spy for LaFayette during his campaign in Virginia, and
at one time gave information of an intended surprise to>
be made upon the forces of the Marquis, thereby saving
probably a rout of the army. Armistead, after the sur¬
render of Cornwallis at Yorktown, was returned to his
master three years after the close of the war. He was
