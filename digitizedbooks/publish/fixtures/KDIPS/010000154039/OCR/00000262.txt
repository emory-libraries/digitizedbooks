History of the Black Phalanx.
defensive and he had little or no offensive power with which to contend
with his adversaries. -Acting on this conviction he had the light guns
dismounted and covered with sand bags, and the same precaution was
adopted to preserve some of the shell guns or fixed carriages. The pro¬
priety of this determination was abundantly demonstrated in the end.
"About a quarter past 8 o'clock the storm broke, ship after ship
and battery after battery, and then apparently all together, vomited
forth their horrid flames and the atmosphere was filled with deadly mis¬
siles. It is impossible for any pen to describe or for anyone who was not
an eye-witness to conceive the frightful grandeur of the spectacle. The
writer has never had the fortune to read any official Federal report or
any other account of the operations of this day except an extract from
the graphic and eloquent address of the Rev. Mr. Dennison, a chaplain of
one of the Northern regiments, delivered on its nineteenth anniversary
at Providence, R. I. He says: 'Words cannot depict the thunder, the
smoke, the lifted sand and the general havoc which characterized that
hot summer day. What a storm of iron fell on that island; the roar of
the guns was incessant; how the shots ploughed the sand banks and the
marshes; how the splinters flew from the Beacon House; how the whole
island smoked like a furnace and trembled as from an earthquake.'
"If that was true outside of Wagner it is easy to conceive how in-
• tensified the situation was within its narrow limits towards which every
hostile gun was pointed. The sand came down in avalanches; huge ver¬
tical shells and those rolled over by the ricochet shots from the ships,
buried themselves and then exploded, rending the earth and forming
great craters, out of which the sand and iron fragments flew high in the
air. It was a fierce sirocco freighted with iron as well as sand. The sand
flew over from the seashore, from the glacis, from the exterior slope,
from the parapet, as it was ploughed up and lifted and driven by resist¬
less force now in spray and now almost in waves over into the work, the
men sometimes half buried by the moving mass. The chief anxiety was
about the magazines. The profile of the fort might be destroyed, the
ditch filled up, the traverses and bomb-proof barracks knocked out of
shape, but the protecting banks of sand would still afford their shelter;
but if the coverings of the magazines were blown away and they became
exposed, the explosion that would ensue would lift fort and garrison into
the air and annihilate all in general chaos. They were carefully watched
and reports of their condition required to be made at short intervals
during the day.
"Wagner replied to the enemy, her 10-inch columbiad alone to the
ships, deliberately at intervals of fifteen minutes, the other'guns to the
land batteries whenever in range, as long as they were serviceable. The
32-pounder rifled gun was soon rendered useless by bursting and within
two hours many other guns had been dismounted and their carriages
destroyed. Sumter, Colonel Alfred Rhett in command, and Gregg, under
charge of Captain Sesesne, with the Sullivan and James Island batteries
at long range, threw all the power of their available metal at the assail-
