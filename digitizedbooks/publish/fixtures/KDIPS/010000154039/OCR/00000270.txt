History of the Black Phalanx.
thirty yards of the enemy's rifle-pits, and poured a volley of minie ball*
into the very faces of those who did not fly on their approach.
"The 7th Connecticut and the 7th New Hampshire, the latter witt
their seven-shooters, Spencer repeaters, Col. Hawley, commanding, hac
taken a stand further to the right of the battery, and were hotly engag
ing the rebels. The Phalanx regiment (8th), after dealing out twc
rounds from its advanced position, finding the enemy's force in the cen
ter preparing to charge upon them, fell back under cover of Hamilton's
battery, which was firing vigorously and effectively into the rebel col
umn. The 7th Connecticut and New Hampshire about this time ran
short of ammunition, and Col. Hawley, finding the rebels outnumbered
his force three to one, was about ordering Col. Abbott to fall back and
out of the concentrated fire of the enemy pouring upon his men, when he
observed the rebels coming in for a down upon his column.
"Here they come like tigers; the Federal column wavers a little; it
staggers and breaks, falling back in considerable disorder 1 Col. Haw¬
ley now ordered Col. Fribley to take his Phalanx Kegiment, the 8th, to
the right of the battery and check the advancing rebel force. No time
was to be lost, the enemy's sharpshooters had already silenced two oi
Hamilton's guns, dead and dying men and horses lay in a heap about
them, while at the remaining four guns a few brave artillerists were load¬
ing and fixing their pieces, retarding the enemy in his onward movement.
" Deficient in artillery, they had not been able to check the Federal
cavalry in its dash, but the concentrated fire from right to center demor¬
alized, and sent them galloping over the field wildly. Col. Fribley gave
the order by the right flank, double quick! and the next moment the 8th
Phalanx swept away to the extreme right in support of the 7th New
Hampshire and the 7th Connecticut. The low, direct aim of the enemy
in the rifle-pits, his Indian sharp-shooters up in the trees, had ere now so
thinned the ranks of Col. Hawley's command that his line was gone, and
the 8th Phalanx met the remnant of his brigade as it was going to the
rear in complete disorder. The rebels ceased firing and halted as the
Phalanx took position between them and their fleeing comrades. They
halted not perforce, but apparently for deliberation, when with one fell
swoop in the next moment they swept the field in their front.
"The Phalanx did not, however, quit the field in a panic-stricken
manner but fell hastily back to the battery, only to find two of the
guns silent and their brave wor'kers and horses nearly all of them dead
upon the field. With a courage undaunted, surpassed by no veteran
troops on any 'battle-field, the Phalanx attempted to save the silent
guns. In this effort Col. Fribley was killed, in the torrent of rebel bullets
which fell upon the regiment. It held the two guns, despite two desper¬
ate charges made by the enemy to capture them, but the stubbornness
of the Phalanx was no match for the ponderous weight of their enemy's
column, their sharpshooters and artillery mowing down ranks of their
comrades at every volley. A grander spectacle was never witnensed than
that which this regiment gave of gallant courage. They left their guns
