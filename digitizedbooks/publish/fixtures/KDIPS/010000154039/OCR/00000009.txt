INTRODUCTION.
By way of introduction to the American public, of
the author and editor of this book, we beg to say that
Mr. Wilson is not altogether unknown to the literary
world, having already published several works relative to
the Negro race.
His services during the war of the Rebellion secured
for him a flattering recognition. He served in the 2nd
Regiment Louisiana Native Guard Volunteers, also the
54th Massachasetts Volunteers,—the most famous of the
Union negro regiments that engaged in the struggle, re¬
ceiving several wounds. He was the first negro member
ot the National Council of Administration of the Grand
Army of the Republic, and a delegate to the National
Encampment, and was appointed Colonel—A. D. C. to the
Commander-in-Chief G. A. R. He was chosen by his com¬
rades to be the historian of the negro soldiers, and has
overcome many almost insurmountable difficulties in
gathering the scattered facts, particularly those of the
early wars of the United States, that were necessary to
complete this work.
