252 History of the Black Phalanx.
have collided with each other; they could have seen their foes, and the
arena of combat, and the fleet could have assisted them with their guns,
and prevented the landing of the re-enforcements from Chaileston.
"It was a beautiful and calin evening when the troops who were to
form the assaulting column moved out on to the broad and smooth
beach left by the receding tide.
"The last rays of the setting sun illumined the grim walls and shat¬
tered mounds of Wagner with a flood of crimson light, too soon, alas I
to be deeper dyed with the red blood of struggling men.
"Our men halted, and formed their ranks upon the beach, a mile and
more away from the deadly breach. Quietly they stood leaning upon
their guns, and awaiting the signal of attack. There stood, side by side,
the hunter of the far "West, the farmer of the North, the stout lumber¬
man from the forests of Maine, and the black Phalanx Massachusetts
had armed and sent to the field.
"In this hour of peril there was no jealousy, no contention. The
black Phalanx were to lead the forlorn hope. And they were proud of
their position, and conscious of its danger. Although we had seen many
of the famous regiments of the English, French, and Austrian armies,
we were never more impressed with the fury and majesty of war than
when we looked upon the solid mass of the thousand black men, as they
stood, like giant statues of marble, upon the snow-white sands of the
beach, waiting the order to advance. And little did we think, as we
gazed with admiration upon that splendid c( 1'imn of four thousand
brave men, that ere an hour had passed, half of them would be swept
away, maimed or crushed in the gathering whirlwind of death I Time
passed quickly, and twilight was fast deepening into the darkness of
night, when the signal was given. Onward moved the chosen and ill-
fated band, making the earth tremble under the heavy and monotonous
tread of the dense mass of thousands of men. Wagner lay black and
grim in the distance, and silent. Not a glimmer of light was seen, Not a
gun replied to the bombs which our mortars still constantly hurled into
the fort. Not a shot was returned to the terrific volleys of the giant
frigate Ironsides, whose shells, ever and anon, plunged into the earth¬
works, illuminating their recesses for an instant in the glare of their ex¬
plosion, but revealing no signs of life.
"Were the rebels all dead? Had they fled from the pitiless storm
which our batteries had poured down upon them for so many hours?
Where were they?
" Down deep beneath the sand heaps were excavated great caverns,
whose floors were level with the tide, and whose roofs were formed of
huge trunks of trees laid in double rows. Still above these massive
beams sand was heaped so deeply that even our enormous shells could
not penetrate the roofs, though they fell from the skies above. In these
dark subterranean retreats two thousand men lay hid, like panthers in a
ewamp, waiting to leap forth in fury upon their prey.
"The signal given, our forces advanced rapidly towards the fort,
