entered the service with alacrity; excluded from the army,
they enlisted in the navy, swelling the number of those
who, upon the rivers, lakes, bays and oceans, manned
the guns of the war vessels, in defense of Free Trade, Sai¬
lor's Rights and Independence on the Seas as well as on
the land. It is quite impossible to ascertain the exact
number of negroes who stood beside the guns that won
for America just recognition from the maritime powers of
the world. Like the negro soldiers in the Revolutionary
war who served with the whites, so the negro sailors in
the war of 1812 served in the American Navy; in the mess,
at the gun, on the yard-arm and in the gangway, to¬
gether with others of various nationalities, they achieved
many victories for the navy of our common country.
The best evidence I can give in substantiation of what

"In 1819,1 was surgeon of the ' Guerriere,' under Commodore Mac-
donough; and the proportion of blacks was about the same in her crew.
There seemed to be an entire absence of prejudice against the blacks as

Yours very respectfully,

Dr. Parsons had reference to the following correspond¬
ence between Captain Perry and Commodore Chauncey,
which took place in 1813, before the former's victory
on Lake Erie. As will be seen, Perry expressed dissatisfac¬
