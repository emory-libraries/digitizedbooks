History of the Black Phalanx.
had won and conquered a much greater and stronger bat¬
tery than that upon the bluff. Nature seems to have se¬
lected the place and appointed the time for the negro to
prove his manhood and to disarm the prejudice that at
one time prompted the white troops to insult and assault
the negro soldiers in New Orleans. It was all forgotten
and they mingled together that day on terms of perfect
equality. The whites were only too glad to take a drink
from a negro soldier's canteen, for in that trying hour
they found a brave and determined ally, ready to sacri¬
fice all for liberty and country. If greater heroism could
be shown than that of the regiments of the Phalanx al¬

the most dangerous place during an engagement, perhaps
to build a redoubt or breastworks behind a brigade, or to
blow up a bastion of the enemy's. " They but reminded
the lookers on," said a correspondent of a Western news¬
paper, " of just so many cattle going to a slaughter¬
house."
A writer, speaking of the other regiments of the Pha¬
lanx, says:
"They were also 011 trial that day, and justified the most sanguine
expectations by their good conduct. Not that they fought better than
our white veterans; they did not and could not."
But there had been so much incredulity avowed re¬
garding the courage of the negroes; so much wit lavished
on the idea of negroes fighting to any purpose, that Gen-
