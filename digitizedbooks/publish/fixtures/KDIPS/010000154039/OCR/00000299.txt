loost, Resaca, Adairsville and Dallas. At the end of that time, haying
;ained invaluable experience, and feeling that my place was with my
egiment, I returned to Chattanooga,-determined to again make every
(ossible effort to get it into active service.
"A few days after I had taken my place on General Howard's staff,
m incident occurred showing how narrowly one may escape death. Gen¬
eral Stanley and a staff officer and General Howard and myself were
naking a little reconnoissance at Buzzards Roost. We stopped to ob¬
serve the movements of the enemy, Stanley standing on the right, How-
ird next on his left, and I next. The fourth officer, Captain Flint, stood
immediately in the rear of General Howard. A sharpshooter paid us a
compliment in the shape of a rifle ball, which struck the ground in front
Df General Howard, ricocheted, passed through the skirt of his coat,
through Captain Flint's cap, and buried itself in a tree behind.
"At Adairsville a group of about a dozen mounted officers were in
an open field, when the enemy exploded a shell just in front and over us,
wounding two officers and five horses. A piece of the shell passed
through the right fore leg of my horse, a kind, docile, fearless animal,
that I was greatly attached to. I lost a friend and faithful servant.
"On asking leave to return to my command, I was delighted to re¬
ceive from General Howard the following note:
"' HEADQUARTERS 4TH aRMY CORPS,
"'On Ackworth and Dallas Road, 8 Miles From Dallas, Ga., May 31st 1864.
'"Colonel:—This is to express my thanks for your services upon my staff during
the past month, since starting upon this campaign. You have given me always full
satisfaction, and more, by your assiduous devotion to duty.
"' You have been active and untiring on the march, and fearless in battle. Believe
me, Your friend, O. O. HOWARD.

"General James B. Steadman, who won such imperishable renown at
Chickamauga, was then in command of the District of Etowah, with
headquarters at Chattanooga. I laid my case before him; he listened
with interest, to my plea, and assured me that if there was any fighting
to be done in his district, we should have a hand in it.
"Dalton, Ga.—August 15th, 1864, we had our first fight, at Dalton,
Georgia. General Wheeler, with a considerable force of confederate cav¬
alry, attacked Dalton, which was occupied by a small detachment of
Union troops belonging to the 2nd Missouri, under command of Colonel
Laibold. General Steadman went to Laibold's aid, and forming line of
battle, attacked and routed the Southern force. My regiment formed on
the left of the 51st Indiana Infantry, under command of Col. A. D.
Straight. The fight was short, and not at all severe. The regiment was
all exposed to fire. One private was killed, one lost a leg, and one was
wounded in the right hand. Company B, on the skirmish line killed five
of the enemy, and wounded others. To us it was a great battle, and a
glbrious victory. The regiment had been recognized as soldiers; it had
taken its place side by side with a white regiment; it had been under
fire. The men had behaved gallantly. A colored soldier had died for
liberty. Others had shed their blood in the great cause. Two or three
