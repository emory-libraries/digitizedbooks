History of the Black Phalanx.
ment the courageous negro soldiers received at the hands
of their captors, who, worse than enraged by strong
drink, gave the battle-cry on their way to the front, "No
quarter to niggers!" This has been admitted by those
in a position, at the time, to know what went on. In his
"Recollections of the Recapture of the Lines," Colonel
Stewart of the 61st Virginia Regiment, says:
" When nearly opposite the portions of our works held by the Fed¬
eral troops, we met several soldiers who werie in the works at the time of
the explosion. Our men began ridiculing them for going to the rear,
when one of them remarked, 'Ah, boys, you have got hot work ahead,
—they are negroes, and show no quarter.' This was the first intimation
we had that we were to fight negro troops, and it seemed to infuse tho
little band with impetuous daring, as they pressed toward the fray. I
never felt more like fighting in my life. Our comrades had been slaugh¬
tered in a most inhuman and brutal manner, and slaves were tramp¬

every heart, and strung every arm with nerves of steel, for the hercu¬
lean task of blood."
On the Monday morning after the assault of Satur¬
day, the Richmond Enquirer said:
"Grant's war cry of 'no quarter' shouted by his negro soldiers,
was returned with interest, we regret to hear, not so heavily as ought
to have been, since some negroes were captured instead of being shot.
Let every salient we are called upon to defend, be a Fort Pillow, and
butcher every negro that Grant hurls against our brave troops, and
permit them not to soil their hands, with the capture of one negro."
There is no truth in the statement. No such cry was
ever made by negro soldiers; and when it is remembered
that the confederate congress, in four short months after
this declaration, began arming slaves for the defense of
Richmond, it is readily seen how deep and with what
sincerity such declarations were made. The Southern
historian Pollard thus describes the situation after the
assault and the ground had again come into the posses¬
sion of the confederates:
" The ground all around was dotted with the fallen, while the sides
and bottom of the crater were literally lined with dead, the bodies lying
in every conceivable position. Some had evidently been killed with the
butts of muskets, as their crushed skulls and badly smashed faces too
plainly indicated.' Within this crater—this hole of forty by eighty feet-
were lying one hundred and thirty-six dead soldiers, besides the wound-
