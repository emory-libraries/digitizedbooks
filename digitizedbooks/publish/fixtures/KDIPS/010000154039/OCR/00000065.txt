The War of 1775.

mand of Gen. Provost occupy Savannah; the surrender of
Charlestown had become necessary; and these evils were
all brought about by the apathy of the white inhabitants.
Among those who spoke out in favor of Col. Laurens'
and Gen. Lincoln's plan, was Hon. James Madison, who,
on the 20th of November, 1780, wrote to Joseph Jones:
"I am glad to find the Legislature persisting in their resolution to
recruit their line of the army for the war; though, without deciding on
the expediency of the mode under their consideration, would it not be as
well to liberate and make soldiers at once of the blacks themselves, as to
make them instruments for enlisting white soldiers ? It would certainly
be more consonant with the principles of liberty: and, with white officers
and a majority of white soldiers, no imaginable danger could be feared
from themselves; as there certainly could be none from the effect of the
example on those who should remain in bondage; experience having
shown that a freedman immediately loses all attachment and sympathy
with his former fellow slaves."
No circumstances under which the South was placed,
could induce either their legislators or the people to adopt
the recommendations of Congress or the advice of the
patriots and statesmen of their section. The opposition
to the arming of the negroes was much stronger than the
love for independence. The British, however, adopted the
plan, and left no stone unturned to augment the strength
of their army. Thousands of negroes flocked to the
Eoyal standard at every opportunity, just as in the war
of the Bebellion in 1861-'65, they sought freedom under
the national banner.
It has ever been the rule among American historians
to omit giving credit to those negroes who sought to gain
their freedom by joining the British. They have generally
also failed to acknowledge the valor of those who swelled
the ranks of the Continental army. Enough, however,
can be gathered, mostly from private correspondence, to
show that the. hope of success for the Americans rested
either in the docility of the negroes at the South, or in
their loyalty to the cause of Independence. At all events,
upon the action of the blacks more than upon the brav-
nentals evinced the most unyielding firmness, and pressed forward with unusual ardor.
Never did men acquit themselves more honorably. They submitted only when for-
eaken by their brethren in arms, and when overpowered by numuers.
