History of the Black Phalanx.
"It seems to me that there is a hard nervous organization at the
bottom of the character of the white, and a soft susceptible one at the
bottom of the character of the black.
"Y. 'What is the difference, considering the above points, between
colored troops recruited from the free States and those from the slave
States?'
"I should say that the free State men, were the best; they have more
of the self-reliance, and approximate nearer to the qualities of the white
man in respect to dash and energy, than those from the ^lave States.
"Summary.—To me they compare favorably with the whites; they
are easily handled, true and obedient; there is less viciousness among
them; they are more patient; they have great constancy. The character
of the white, as you know, runs to extremes; one has bull-dog courage,
another is a pitiful cur; one is excessively vicious, another pure and
noble. The phases of the character of the white touches the stars and
descends to the lowest depths. The blacks character occupies the inner
circle. Their status is mediocrity, and this mediocrity and uniformity,
for military fatigue duty, I think, answers best.

for fatigue duty, requesting my opinion as derived from observation and
actual intercourse with them, on several specified points, which I subjoin
with the respective answers.
"I. 'Courage as indicated by conduct under fire.'
"I have found that the black troops manifest more timidity under
fire than the white troops, but they are at the same time more obedient
to orders, and more under control of their officers, in dangerous situar
tions, than white soldiers.
"II. 'Skill and appreciation of their duties with reference to the
quality of the work performed.'
" White soldiers are more intelligent and experienced and of course
more skillful than the black ones, but they have not generally a corres¬
ponding appreciation of their duties. As a consequence I have found in
most cases the work as well done by black as by white soldiers.
"III. 'Industry and perseverence with reference to the amount of
work performed,'
" White soldiers work with more energy while they do work than the
