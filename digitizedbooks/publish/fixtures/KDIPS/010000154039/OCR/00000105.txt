the restoration of tlie Union,—to eliminate the anti-slav¬
ery sentiment, which demanded the freedom of the slaves.
Hon. Elisha It. Potter, of Rhode Island,—"who may,"
said Mr. Greeley, "be fairly styled the hereditary chief of
the Democratic party of that State,"—made a speech on
the war in the State Senate, on the 10th of August 1861,
in which he remarked:
I have said that the war may assume another aspect, and be a short
and bloody one. And to such a war—an anti-slavery war—it seems to
me we are inevitably drifting. It seems to me hardly in the power of
human wisdom to prevent it. We may commence the war without
meaning to interfere with slavery; but let us have one or two battles,
and get our blood excited, and we shall not only not restore any more
slaves, but shall proclaim freedom wherever we go. And it seems to me
almost judicial blindness on the part of the South that they do not see
that this must be the inevitable result, if the contest is prolonged."
This sentiment became bolder daily as the thinking
Union men viewed the army turning aside from its legiti¬
mate purposes, to catch runaway negroes, and return
them. Party lines were also giving away; men in the
army began to realize the worth of the negroes as they
sallied up to the rebel breastworks that were often impreg¬
nable. They began to complain, finding the negro with
his pick and spade, a greater hinderance to their progress
than the cannon balls of the enemy; and more than one
said to the confederates, when the pickets of the two
armies picnicked together in the battle's lull, as frequently
they did: "We can whip you, if you keep your negroes
out of your army."
Quite a different course was pursued in the navy.
Negroes were readily accepted all along the coast on
board the war vessels, it being no departure from the regu¬
lar and established practice in the service. The view with
which the loyal friends of the Union began to look at the
negro and the rebellion, was aptly illustrated in an article
in the Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser in 1861, which said:
"The Slaves as a Military Element in the South—The total
white population of the eleven States now comprising the Confederacy is
6,000,000, and, therefore, to fill up the ranks of the proposed army
(600,000) about ten per cent of the entire white population will be
