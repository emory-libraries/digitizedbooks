borrow a detail to clean and beautify the quarters of their
commands. An occurrence of this kind came very near
causing trouble on Morris Island, S. C. The matter was
brought to the commanding General's attention and he
immediately issued this order:
DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Headquarters in the Field.
Genebal Obdebs,\ Morris Island, S. C., Sept. 17th, 1863.
No. 77. /
I. It has come to the knowledge of the Brig. Gen. Commanding that detachmenfs of
colored troops, detailed for fatigue duty, have been employed in one instance at least,
to prepare camps and perform menial duty for white troops. Such use of these details
is unauthorized and improper, and is hereafter expressly prohibited. Commanding
Officers of colored regiments are directed to report promptly, to the Headquarters,
■any violations of this order which may come to their knowledge.

The Southern troops generally made no objection to
cleaning the quarters of their white allies, but when a
detail from the 54th Mass. Reg't., on its way to the front,
was re-detailed for that purpose, they refused to obey.
The detail was placed under arrest. When this informa¬
tion reached the regiment it was only by releasing the
prisoners that a turbulent spirit was quieted. There were
about ten thousand negro troops in and about Morrjs Is¬
land at that time, and they quickly sneezed at the 54th's
snuff. The negro barbers in this department had been
refusing to shave and to cut the hair of negro soldiers
in common with the whites. Corporal Kelley of the 54th
Mass. Regiment, who had been refused a shave at a shop
located near one of the brigade Headquarters, went there
one evening accompanied by a number of the members of
Company C. The men gathered around the barber's
place of business, which rested upon posts a little up from
the ground; the negro barbers were seated in their chairs
resting from their labors and listening to the concert,
which it was customary for a band to give each evening.
As the last strains of music were being delivered, one side
of the barber shop was lifted high and then suddenly
dropped; it came down with a crash making a wreck of
the building and its contents, except the barbers, who
escaped unhurt, but who never made their appearance
again. The episode resulted in the issuing of an order
forbidding discrimination on account of color.
