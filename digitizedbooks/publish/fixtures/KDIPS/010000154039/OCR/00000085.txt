The organization of negro troops was now fairly
"begun; at the South enlistment was confined to the free
negroes as set forth in Gen. Jackson's Proclamation. In
New York, the slaves who should enlist with the consent
of their owners were to be free at the expiration of their

above.

has ever prompted them, notwithstanding the disabilities
under which they labored, to enter the ranks of their
country's defenders whenever that country has been
assailed by foes without or traitors within, the negroes
responded to the call of General Jackson and to that of
New York, with a zeal and energy characteristic only of a
brave and patriotic people. Inspired by the hope of im¬
partial liberty, they rallied to the support of that banner
which Commodore Barron lowered when he failed to pro¬
tect them from British aggression, but which Commodore
Decatur gallantly and successfully defended.
