loved and honored by all who had ever known him. The heavy work
imposed upon the garrison in repairs and construction, as well as the
strain upon the system by constant exposure to the enemy's fire, had in¬
duced General Beauregard to adopt the plan of relieving the garrison
every few days by fresh troops. The objection to this was that the new
men had to be instructed and familiarized with their duties; but still it
was wise and necessary, for the same set of officers and men, if retained
any length of time, would have been broken down by the arduous ser¬
vice required of them. The relief was sent by regiments and detach¬
ments, so there was never an entirely new body of men in the works.
" The garrison was estimated at one thousand seven hundred aggre¬
gate. The staff of General Taliaferro consisted of Captain Twiggs,
Quartermaster General; Captain W. T. Taliaferro, Adjutant General;
Lieutenants H. C. Cunningham and Magyck, Ordnance Officers; Lieuten¬
ants Meade and Stoney, Aides-de-Camp; Major Holcombe; Captain Burke,
Quartermaster, and Habersham, Surgeon-in-Chief; Private Stockman, of
McEnery's Louisiana Battalion, who had been detailed as clerk because
of his incapacity for other duty from most honorable wounds, acted also
in capacity of aid.
"The Charleston Battalion was assigned to that part of the work
which extended from the Sally port or Lighthouse Inlet creek around to
the left until it occupied part of the face to the south, including the wes¬
tern bastion; the Fifty-first North Carolina connected with these troops
on the left and extended to the southeast bastion; the rest of the work
was to be occupied by the Thirty-first North Carolina Regiment, and a
small force from that regiment was detailed as a reserve, and two cam-
panies of the Charleston Battalion were to occupy outside of the fort
the covered way spoken of and some sand-hills by the seashore; the ar¬
tillery was distributed among the several gun-chambers and the light
pieces posted on a traverse outside so as to sweep to sea face and the
right approach. The positions to be occupied were well known to every
officer and man and had been verified repeatedly by day and night, so
there was no fear of confusion, mistake or delay in the event of an as¬
sault. The troops of course were not ordered to these positions when at
6 o'clock it was evident a furious bombardment was impending, but, on
the contrary, to the shelter of the bomb-proofs, sand-hills and parapet; a
few sentinels or videttes were detailed and the gun detachments only
ordered to their pieces.
"The Charleston Battalion preferred the freer air of the open work
to the stifling atmosphere of the bomb-proofs and were permitted to
shelter themselves under the parapet and traverses. Not one of that
heroic band entered the opening of a bomb-proof during that frightful
day. The immense superority of the enemy's artillery was well under¬
stood and appreciated by the Confederate commander, and it was clear
to him that his policy was to husband his resources and preserve them
as best he could for the assault, which it was reasonable to expect would
occur during the day. He recognized the fact that his guns were only
