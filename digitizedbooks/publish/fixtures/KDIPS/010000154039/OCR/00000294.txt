History of the Black Phalanx.
and were without experience, except as soldiers. The colored men knew
nothing of the duties of a soldier, except a little they had picked up as
camp-followers.
" Fortunately there was one man, Mr. A. H. Dunlap, who had had
some clerical experience with Col. Birney, in Baltimore, in organizing the
3rd U. S. Colored Infantry. He was an intelligent, methodical gentle¬
man, and rendered me invaluable service. I had no Quartermaster; no
Surgeon; no Adjutant. We had no tents, and the men were sheltered in
an old filthy tobacco warehouse, where they fiddled, danced, sang, swore
or prayed, according to their mood.
" How to meet the daily demands made upon us for military duty,
and at the same time to evoke order out of this chaos, was no easy prob¬
lem. The first thing to be done was to examine the men. A room was
prepared, and I and my clerk took our stations at a table. One by one
the recruits came before us a la Eden, sans the fig leaves, and were sub¬
jected to a careful medical examination, those who were in any way
physically disqualified being rejected. Many bore the wounds and bruises
of the slave-driver's lash, and many were unfit for duty by reason of
some form of disease to which human flesh is heir. In the course of a
few weeks, however, we had a thousand able-bodied, stalwart men.
"I was quite as solicitous about their mental condition as about
their physical status, so I plied them with questions as to their history,
their experience with the army, their motives for becoming soldiers, their
ideas of army life, their hopes for the future, *kc., &c. I found that a
considerable number of them had been teamsters, cooks, officers' ser¬
vants, &c., and had thus seen a good deal of hard service in both armies,
in camp, on the march and in battle, and so knew pretty well what
to expect. In this respect they had the advantage of most raw recruits
from the North, who were wholly ' unusued to wars' alarms.' Some of
them had very noble ideas of manliness. I remember picturing to one
bright-eyed fellow some of the hardships of camp life and campaigning,
and receiving from him the cheerful reply,' I know all about that.' I
then said, 'you may be killed in battle.' He instantly answered, 'many
a better man than me has been killed in this war.' When I told another
one who wanted to 'fight for freedom,' that he might lose his life, he re¬
plied, ' but my people will be free.'
" The result of this careful examination convinced me that these men,
though black in skin, had men's hearts, and only needed right handling
to develope into magnificent soldiers. Among them were the same varie¬
ties of physique, temperament, mental and moral endowments and ex¬
periences, as would be found among the same number of white men.
Some of them were finely formed and powerful; some were almost white;
a large number had in their veins white blood of the F. F. V. quality;
some were men of intelligence, and many of. them deeply religious.
"Acting upon my clerk's suggestion, I assigned them to companies
according to their height, putting men of nearly the same height to¬
gether. When the regiment was full, the four center companies were all
