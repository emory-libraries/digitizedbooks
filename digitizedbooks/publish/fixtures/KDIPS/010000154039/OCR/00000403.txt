The Phalanx in Virginia.
401
Then shells came crashing through the line, dealing
death and shattering the ranks; but on they went, with a
wild cheer, running up the slope; again a storm of can-
nister met them; a shower of musketry came down
upon the advancing column, whose bristling bayonets
were to make the way clear for their white comrades
awaiting on the roadside. A hundred black men went
down under the fire; the ranks were quickly closed how¬
ever, and with another wild cheer the living hundreds went
over the works with the impetuosity of a cyclone; they
seized the cannon and turned them upon the fleeing foe,
who, in consternation, stampeded toward Petersburg, to
their main line of intrenchments on the east. Thus the
work of the 5th and 22nd Phalanx regiments was com¬
pleted and the road made clear for the 18th Corps.
Brooks now moved up simultaneously with Martin-
dale, on the river road. By noon the whole corps was in
front of the enemy's mainline of works, Martindale on the

the left, sweeping down to the Jerusalem Plank Road on
the southeast. Hinks, with the Phalanx, in order to gain
the position assigned him, had necessarily to pass over
an open space exposed to a direct and cross-fire. Never¬
theless, he prepared to occupy his post, and forming a
line of battle, he began the march. The division numbered
about 3,000, a portion of it being still at Wilson's Land¬
ing, Fort Powhatan, City Point and Bermuda Hundreds.
This was a march that veterans might falter in, without
criticism or censure. The steady black line advanced
a few rods at a time, when coming within range of the
confederate guns they were obliged to lie down and wait
for another opportunity. Now a lull,—they would rise,
go forward, and again lie down. Thus they continued
their march, under a most galling, concentrated artillery
fire until they reached their position, from which they
were to join in a general assault; and here they lay, from
one till five o'clock,—four long hours,—exposed to cease¬
less shelling by the enemy. Badeau says, in speaking of
the Phalanx in this ordeal:
