brea bean soup and a little meat. This did not last long, for as the
number of prisoners increased our rations were diminished. There were
four old log houses within the stockade and into these the officers were
moved the next day, while a thousand or more prisoners, brought on
from Petersburg, were turned into the pen without shelter of any kind.
From these we were separated by a line of sentinels, who had orders to
shoot any who approached within six paces of their beat on either side.
This was called the ' dead-line,' which also extended around the enclosure
about six paces from the stockade.
"'The second Sunday after our arrival, just as we were assembling
to hear preaching, an officer who had thoughtlessly stepped to a tree on
the dead-line was shot and killed by the sentry, who was on an elevated
platform outside the fence, and only about two rods distant. For this
fiendish act the murderer was granted a sixty days furlough.
"'Prisoners were being brought in almost daily, and at this time
there were probably six thousand within the enclosure. A pretence of
shelter was furnished by the issue of a few Sibley tents, but not more
than a third of the prisoners were sheltered. Many of them built mud
hovels or burrowed in the ground; some crawled under the hospital
building. Yery few had blankets and all were thinly clad, and the rations
were barely sufficient to sustain life. What wonder that men lost their
strength, spirits, and sometimes reason. The story of exposure, sickness
and death is the same and rivals that of Andersonville.
'"The guard was strengthened, a portion of the fence taken down and
a piece of artillery stationed at the corners to sweep down the crowd,
should an outbreak occur. This we had thought of for some time, and
a plan of action was decided upon. At a given signal all within the en¬
closure were to make a break for that part of the fence nearest them, and
then scatter, each one for himself. Of course, some would probably be
killed, but it was hoped most would escape before the guards could load
and fire a second time. This plot, which was to have been carried out
at midnight, was discovered the previous afternoon. The inside guard,
separating the enlisted-men from the officers, had become more vigilant,
and the only means of communication w&s to attach a note to a stone
and throw it across. This an officer attempted. The note fell short; the
sentry picked it up, called the corporal of the guard, who took it to the
officer of the guard, and in less than five minutes the whole arrangement
was known. Two hours afterward we were formed in line and learned
that we were to change our quarters. We had then been in Salisbury
twenty days. Before we left one of our mess found and brought away a
bound copy of Harper's Magazine. It proved a boon to us, as it served
for a pillow for one of us at night, and was being read by some one from
dawn until night, until we had all read it through, when we traded it off
for a volume of the Portland Transcript.
"'We were packed in box cars and started North. The next morn¬
ing we arrived at Danville and were confined in a tobacco warehouse,
»>uilt of brick and about eighty feet long, forty wide, and three stories
