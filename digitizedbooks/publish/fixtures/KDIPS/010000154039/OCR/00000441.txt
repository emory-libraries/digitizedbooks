The Phalanx in Virginia.

Smith and Lieut. Prime, both of Company G, here fell grievously
wounded, while forty or fifty enlisted-men dotted the plain with their
prostrate forms.
" 'In a few minutes the ditch of the fort was reached. It was some
six or seven feet deep and ten or twelve wide, the excavated material
sufficing for the embankments of the fort. Some 120 men and officers
precipitated themselves into it, many losing their lives at its very edge.
After a short breathing spell men were helped up the exterior of the
parapet on the shoulders of others; fifty or sixty being thus disposed an
attempt was made to storm the fort. At the signal nearly all rose, but
the enemy, lying securely sheltered behind the interior slope, the muzzles
of their guns almost touching the storming party, received the latter
with a crushing fire, sending many into the ditch below shot through
the brain or breast. Several other attempts were made with like result,
till at last forty or fifty of the assailants were writhing in the ditch or
resting forever.
'"The defense having been obviously re-enforced meanwhile from
other points not so directly attacked, and having armed the gunners
with muskets, it was considered impolitic to attempt another storm
with the now greatly reduced force on. hand, especially as the cessation
of the artillery fire of the fort was considered a sufficient hint to the
commander of the Union forces that the attacking party had come to
close quarters and were proper subjects for re-enforcements.. No signs,
however, of the latter appearing, it was decided to surrender, especially
as the rebels had now commenced to roll lighted shells among the
stormers, against which there was no defense, thus inviting demoraliza¬
tion. Seven officers, Capts. Weiss and McCarty, Lieuts. Sherman, Mack,
Spinney, Ferguson and Eler, and from seventy to eighty enlisted-men,
delivered up their arms to an enemy gallant enough to have fought for
a better cause.
"'Many, in mounting the parapet, could not help taking a last
mournful look on their dead comrades in the ditch, whose soldierf> qual¬
ities had endeared them to their best affections; and many, without for
a moment selfishly looking at their own dark future, were oppressed with
inexpressible sadness when reflecting on the immensity of the sacrifice
and the deplorableness of the result. It was a time for rr.^nly tears.'
" Lieut Spinney gives the following account of the charge against
Fort Gilmer:
" ' The charge was made in quick time, in open ordnr of about three
paces, until we could plainly see the enemy; then the o) -der was given by
Capt. Weiss to 'double-quick,' which was promptly obeyed, the line pre¬
serving its order as upon drill. Upon arriving at the ditch there was no
wavering, but every man jumped into the trap from which but one man
returned that day (George W. Washington, Company D.)
" 'Upon looking about us after getting into the ditch we found there
was but one face where the enemy could not touch us, so all the survi¬
vors rallied at that face. Then commenced a scene which will always be
very fresh in my memory.
"'Capt. Weiss gave orders to raise men upon the parapet, which
was done by two men assisting one to climb. Capt. Weiss, having from
thirty to forty men up, attempted to gain the inside of the fort, but he
with all of his storming party were knocked back, either killed or
wounded, into the ditch. A second attempt was made with the same
result, Lieut. Ferguson being wounded by a bullet across the top of
his head. A third attempt was made with no better success.
"' The enemy during this time had been rolling shell upon us, and
calling upon us to surrender, which was answered by some of the men
