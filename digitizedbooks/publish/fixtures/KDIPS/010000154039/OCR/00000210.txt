208 History of the Black Phalanx.
the opposite shore was a railroad leading to Mobile by
which re-enforcements were going forward to Charleston.
Colonel Daniels conceived the idea of destroying the road
to prevent the transportation of the confederate troops.
Accordingly, with about two hundred men he landed at
Pascagoula, on the morning of the 9th of April. Pickets
were immediately posted on the outskirts of the town,
while the main body marched up to the hotel. Before long
some confederate cavalry; having been apprised of the
movement, advanced, drove in the pickets, and com¬

cavalry made a bold dash upon the left of the negroes,

things, put spurs to his horse and went to their succor,
reaching them just as a company of the enemy's cavalry
made a charge. The Major, placing himself at the head
of the hard-pressed men, not only repulsed the cavalry
and rescued the squad, but captured the enemy's stand-
