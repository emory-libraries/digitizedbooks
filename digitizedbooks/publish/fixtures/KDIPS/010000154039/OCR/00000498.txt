History of the Black Phalanx.
federate authorities then sought to strengthen the army
by conscripting all able-bodied negroes, free and slave,
between the age of eighteen and fifty. Monday, April
3d, was appointed as the day to begin the draft. The
Virginia State Legislature had come to the rescue of the
Davis-Lee-Benjamin scheme, and so had the local authori¬
ties of Bichmond, but all was to no purpose. It was too
late; they had delayed too long.
With a pitiable blindness to the approach of his
downfall, only a few days before he became a fugitive, Jef¬
ferson Davis wrote the following letter: *
" Richmond, Va., March 30th, 1865.
"His Excellency William Smith, Governor of Virginia:
"Upon the receipt of your letter of the 27th inst. I had a conference
with the Secretary of War and Adjutant-General in relation to your
suggestion as to the published order for the organization of negro
troops, and I hope that the modification which has been made will
remove the objection which you pointed out. It was never my intention
to collect negroes in depots for purposes of instruction, but only as the
best mode of forwarding them, either as individuals or as companies, to
the command with which they were to serve. The officers in the differ¬
ent posts will aid in providing for the negroes in their respective neigh¬
borhoods, and in forwarding them to depots where transportation will
be available, and aid them in reaching the field of service for which they
were destined. The aid of gentlemen who are willing and able to raise
this character of troops will be freely accepted. The appointment of
commanders, for reasons obvious to you, mpgt depend on other consid¬
erations than the mere power to recruit.
"I am happy to receive your assurance of success as well as your
promise to seek legislation to secure unmistakably freedom to the slave
who shall enter the army, with a right to return to his old home when
lie shall have been honorably discharged from the military service.
"I remain of the opinion that we should cipnfine our first efforts to
getting volunteers, and would prefer that you would adopt such meas¬
ures as would advance that mode of recruiting, rather than that of
which you make enquiry, to wit: by issuing requisitions for the slaves as
authorized by the State of Virginia.
'' I have the honor to be, with much respect,
"Your obedient servant,
JEFFERSON DAVIS."
