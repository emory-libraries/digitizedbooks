Officers of the Phalanx.

The first Kansas regiment which recruited in that
State, commencing in August, 1862, was also fortunate in
having Colonel R. J. Hinton.
General Butler, at New Orleans, was prevented by cir¬
cumstances surrounding him at the time, from choosing
among the friends of the negro race, as was the case in the
before mentioned regiments, men to command the first
and second regiments organized by him in the above named
city, in August, 1862. He was only too glad to find white
men of military capacity to take charge of the drilling and
disciplining of the troops. As an experiment he was more
than lucky in the appointment of Colonels Stafford and
Daniels to the command of these regiments, seconded by
Lieut. Cols. Bassett and Hall, and Finnegass of the 3rd
Regiment. These officers proved themselves worthy of
the trust reposed in them, and made these regiments, in
drill and discipline, second to none in the Department of
the Gulf. Notwithstanding the captains and subordinate
officers of the first and second regiments were men, who
like those in a large majority of the white regiments had
never made arms a profession, and, who, through Ameri¬
can prejudice, had but very limited opportunities for
acquiring even the rudiments of a common English educa¬
tion. Several of them, however, being mulattoes, had had
some training in the schools of the parishes, and some few
in the higher schools of France, and in the Islands of the
Carribean Sea. Maj. Dumas, of the 2nd Regiment, whose
slaves composed nearly one whole company, was a gentle¬
man of fine tact and ability, as were others.
Considering that they were all negroes, free and slave,
their dash and manly courage, no less than their military
aptitude, was equal, and in many instances superior, to
those found in the regiments of Maine and New York. The
3rd Regiment was officered by soldiers of undoubted char¬
acter and pluck, as they proved themselves to be, during
the seige of Port Hudson, especially Capt. Quinn, who
won distinction and promotion, as the record shows. The
regiments raised thereafter were officered, more or less,
by the non-commissioned officers of the white regiments,
