The Phalanx in Virginia.
eral Meade had an interview with General Burnside on
the 28th; the subject was fully discussed as to the plan of
the assault, as proposed by General Burnside, and made
known to Meade by Burnside, in writing, on the 26th. It
was at this meeting that General Meade made his objec¬
tions to the Phalanx leading the assault. General Burn¬
side argued with all the reason he could command, in
favor of his plans, and especially for the Phalanx, going
over the grounds already cited; why his white troops
were unfit and disqualified for performing the task of
leading the assault, but in vain. Meade was firm in his.
purpose, and, true to his training, he had no use for the
negro but as a servant; he never had trusted him as a

General Burnside issued his battle order, in accordance
with General Meade's plan and instructions, and at the
appointed hour all the troops were in readiness for the
conflict. The mine, with its several tons of powder, was
ready at a quarter past three o'clock on the eventful
morning of the 30th of July. The fuses were fired, and
"all eyes were turned to the confederate fort opposite,'r
which was discernible but three hundred feet distant.
The garrison was sleeping in fancied security; the senti¬
nels slowly paced their rounds, without a suspicion of the
crust which lay between them and the awful chasm below.
Our own troops, lying upon their arms in unbroken
silence, or with an occasional murmur, stilled at once by
