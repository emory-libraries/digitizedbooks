On enrolling yourselves in companies, the Major-General Command¬
ing will select officers for your government from your white fellow-citi¬

yourselves.

my wishes to tHe Governor of Louisiana, who is fully informed as to the
manner of enrollment, and will give you every necessary information on
the subject of this address.
Andrew Jackson, Major-General Commanding.
