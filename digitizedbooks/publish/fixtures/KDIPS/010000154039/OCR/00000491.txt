rie?, will endeavor to answer them by a statement of my views on the
subject.
"I shall be most happy if I can contribute to the solution of a ques¬
tion in which I feel an interest commensurate with my desire for the
welfare and happiness of our people.
"Considering the relation of master and slave controlled by human
laws, and influenced by Christianity and an enlightened public sentiment,
as the best that can exist between the white and black races, while inter¬
mingled as at present in this country, I would deprecate any sudden
disturbance of that relation, unless it be necessary to avert a
greater calamity to both. I should, therefore, prefer to rely on our
white population to preserve the ratio between our forces and that of
the enemy, which experience has shown to be safe. But in view of the
preparations of our enemies it is our duty to prepare for continued war
and not for a battle or a campaign, and I own I fear we can not accom¬
plish this without overtaxing the capacity of our white population.
"Should the war continue under existing circumstances the enemy
may in course of time penetrate our country, and get access to a large
part of our slave population. It is his avowed policy to convert the
able-bodied men among them into soldiers, and emancipate all. The
success of the federal arms in the south was followed by a proclamation
from President Lincoln for two hundred and eighty thousand men, the
effect of which will be to stimulate the northern states to procure as
substitutes for their own people the negroes thus brought within their
reach. Many have already been obtained in Virginia, and should the
fortunes of war expose more of her territory the enemy will gain a large
accession of strength. His progress will thus add to his numbers, and
at the same time destroy slavery in a manner most pernicious to the
welfare of our people. Their negroes will be used to hold them in sub¬
jection, leaving the remaining force of the enemy free to extend his
conquest.
" Whatever may be the effect of our employing negro troops it can
not be as mischievous as this. If it end in subverting slavery it will be
accomplished by ourselves, and we can devise the means of alleviating
the evil consequences to both races. I think, therefore, we must decide
whether slavery shall be extinguished by our enemies and the slaves be
used against us, or use them ourselves at the risk of the effects which
may be produced upon our social institutions. My own opinion is that
we should employ them without delay. I believe that, with proper regu¬
lations, they can be made effective soldiers. They possess the physical
qualifications in an eminent degree. Long habits of obedience and sub¬
ordination, coupled with that moral influence which in our country the
white man possesses over the black, furnish the best foundation for that
discipline which is the surest guarantee of military efficiency. Our chief
aim should be to secure their fidelity. There have been formidable armies
composed of men having no interests in the country for which they
fought beyond their pay or the hope of plunder. But it is certain that
