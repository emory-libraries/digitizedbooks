which the negro regiment held the extreme left, and thus prevented the
rebels getting in the rear of the Union troops.
"22d.—Companies A and G drove back some rebel pickets, capturing
one man, horse, equipments, and two rifles. The man was thrown by
his horse and was badly hurt, his head striking against a tree.
" 23d.—We formed a junction to-day with Banks, and Port Hudson
is invested.
" 24th.—Companies E and G, under Captain Blake, on a scout.
' 25th.—To-day the regiment marched from the extreme left to the
extreme right of the Union line, a hard long tramp again in heavy
order. At night we encamped near Sandy Creek, close to the Mississippi.
Each man had to carry his own baggage. This regiment was never
given any wagons.
"26th.—At Sandy Creek protecting men laying the pontoon bridge.
Skirmishing all day with the rebels. The boys are getting used to
fighting.
"27th.—Storming the batteries. The negro soldiers prove the bravest
of the brave. To-day was fought one of the most desperate battles on
record. Our brigade, six companies of the 1st, and nine companies of
3rd Regiment Louisiana Native Guards, commenced fighting at quarter
of an hour before 6 a. m. The 1st, under Lieutenant-Colonel Bassett,
advanced in skirmish line up through the wood and soon drew the
enemy's fire. The 3rd under Lieutenant-Colonel Finnegass, were in line
of battle about fifty yards in rear of the first, the whole command
under Colonel John A. Nelson, of the 3rd Regiment. The rebels opened
with infantry fire and shells at short range, and their fire was very effec¬
tive and for a short time the first, which was in danger of utter des¬
truction, wavered, when Colonel Bassett and his colored officers moved
among the men encouraging them by their own fearless examples. At
this crisis, Colonel Finnegass sent forward his four left companies, under
Captain John E. Quinn, to support the 1st. Captain Quinn moved up
in good order, placing his left company under Lieutenant John O'Keefe
so as to face the bridge on his left, held by the rebels in rifle-pits, Finne¬
gass keeping the other five companies well in hand, to use them when
most needed. When within pistol shot of the fortifications, to their
dismay they were stopped—not by the rebels, but by a back flow of the
river. The water was not more than forty feet across, but over eight
feet deep. To cross this without boat or bridge was impossible, particu¬
larly under such a terrible fire as the rebels poured upon them in front
and on both flanks. On the left the rebels were actually in their rear
so far had the gallant fellows advanced. The slaughter was now be¬
coming fearful. Colonel Finnegass at this juncture asked Captain
Quinn if he could cross the water; Quinn called on volunteers to follow
him. The whole that was left of his own company, G, and lieutenant
O'Keefe with Company E, responded to his call, and in they plunged, the
men holding their rifles and cartridge boxes above their heads. In the
mean time Bassett and Finnegass (whose men were lying down) kept a
continual fire on the rebel gunners and drove them from their guns, but
the water was too much for the men, and only 35 or 40—with Quinn
and O'Keefe and Lieutenants Burnham and Dame—succeeded in cross¬
ing. This handful actually followed their reckless leader up to the very
cannon's mouth, and for 15 or 20 minutes held the whole rebel battery
in their hands. Colonel Finnegass seeing that in a few minutes more
his brave men would be destroyed, rushed into the water and ordered
Quinn to fall back, as a regiment of rebels were clambering over the
works to get in their rear. The brave fellows fell back, but alas, few
of them ever answered roll-call again. Out of the band but six re-crossed
alive and of these, Lieutenants O'Keefe, Burnham and Sergeants Yin-
cent 'and Taylor, who were wounded; Quinn and Dame were the only
