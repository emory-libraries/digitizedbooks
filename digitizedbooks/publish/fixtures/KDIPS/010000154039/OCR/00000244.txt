242 History of the Black Phalanx.
with him the whole army, except one section of artillery and two brigades of Infantry,
of which the 2nd Kans&s colored formed a part.
" These two brigades—six regiments in all—stood in line of battle all night long,
while the rain poured in torrents most of the time.
"During the night the enemy's infantry moved up and ■formed in olir immediate
front; in fact made every necessary preparation for battle, white the dog fancier, who
was unfortunately at the head of our army across the river, was either sleeping or de¬
vising the ways and means by which he could most easily elude the enemy.
"But when daylight came the six regiments were there in line, every man ready, will¬
ing and determined to return, volley for volley, and if necessary force the fighting, so
as to bring on a general engagement. . .
"There were but six regiments of us south of the river, with two pieces of artillery.
But we were there to stay until a battle was fought.
" General Rice of Iowa, formed his brigade in the center; the 12th Kansas Infantry,
commanded by Col. Hayes was on his left, and the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry, com¬
manded by myself, was on the right.
"As soon as it was fairlv light, the battle began; both lines moving slightly forward
until within close range. From the beginning, the crash of musketry was terrific. Our
men stood firm against the advanced Division of the enemy's infantry, and used their
Springfield and Enfield rifles with deadly effect.
"The enemy seeing our weakness in numbers, pressed heavily in the center and upon
both flanks, with the evident design of breaking our line before re-enforcements could
reach us.
"But in this they Were disappointed. We held our position until re-enforcements
arrived.
"At one time my regiment was under a heavy fire from the front and also from the
flank, but not a man wavered. In fact it seemed to inspire them with additional cour¬
age. The re-enforcements as they arrived, passed to the rear and formed on the left,
leaving me to hold the right. After about three hours hard fighting, the enemy having
failed to dislodge my regiment from its position, which was regarded as the key to the
situation, brought into position a battery of artillery, planted it immediately in front
of my regiment and opened with canister.
"As soon as this was done I gave the order to cease firing and fix bayonets, and
followed that immediately with the order to charge the battery.
" These orders were executed with a courage and daring seldom equaled by even
older troops, and never excelled by a volunteer regiment.
"In lesa than two minutes from the time the charge was ordered, the rebel battery
was in our possession, and out of thirty-six horses used in the battery, but two were
left standing when we passed the guns.
" Most of the artillery-men lay dead and wounded around the battery while the line
of infantry support in the rear of battery, fell back in disorder before our bayonets;
not, however, until many of them had for the first time felt the effects of cold steel.
"The charge, though bloody on both sides, was pre-eminently successful, and my
regiment, "the 2nd Iron Clads," as it was called,brought away the battery so captured.
" In the charge, the regiment lost in killed and wounded, some forty odd men and
officers. All of our jhorses, field and staff, were shot and most of them killed. The
color bearer Harrison Young, a hero among men, was wounded and fell, raised to his
feet and was again twice wounded. A comrade then took the flag and was wounded,
and a third man brought it off the field.
" A wounded lieutenant of the battery was brought to me, as a prisoner; * but in
view of the massacre of colored troops by the rebels at Fort Pillow and other places, I
sent the Lieutenant immediately back through the lines, pointing him to the regiment
that had made the charge, and telling him that since the rebel authorities had conclu¬
ded to take no prisoners, belonging to colored regiments, it would hardly be proper for
me to hold him as a prisoner; that they had established the precedent, and that in so
far as I was concerned, they could 'lay on MacDuff.' The Lieutenant rejoined his com¬
mand a sadder if not a wiser man.
"After the charge I moved with my regiment to the centre, where the battle was
then raging hottest. Here it remained in the thickest of the fight until an advance was
* " Colonel Crawford ordered the prisoners to be taken to the rear without insult or
injury, which conduct on his part is in striking contrast to the treatment bestowed
upon our colored troops at Poison Springs. He also told a rebel lieutenant and
other prisoners to inform their commanding General that colored troops had captured
them, and that he must from necessity leave some of his wounded men in hospitals by
the way, and that he should expect the same kind treatment shown to them that he
showed to those falling into his hands; but that just such treatment as his wounded
men received at their hands, whether kindness or death, should from this time forward,
be meted out to all rebel falling Into his hands. That if they wished to treat aa
prisoners of war our colored soldiers, to be exchanged for theirs, the decision was their
own; but if they could afford to murder our colored prisoners to gratify their fiendish
dispositions and passions, the responsibit.v of commensurate retaliation, to bring them
to a sense of justice, was also their own. But, notwithstanding the kindness shown to
their prisoners, so soon as our command left, a Texas soldier, in the presence of one
of their officers, killed, in the hospital, nine of the wounded men belonging to the 2nd
Kansas Colored Infantry."—McAfee's Military History of Kansas.
