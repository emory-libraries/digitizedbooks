lant Major Smith, of that regiment, the detachments of cavalry and
Indian troops before mentioned and four pieces of artillery, making alto¬
gether a, force of about twelve hundred men. With this force, after an
engagement of two hours duration, the enemy was dislodged and driven
from his position in great disorder, with a loss of one hundred killed and
wounded and eight prisoners. The loss on our side was eight killed
and twenty-five wounded, including Major Foreman, who was shot from
his horse while attempting to lead his men across the creek under the fire
of the enemy, ahd Captain Ethan Earl, of the 1st Colored, who was
wounded at the head of his company. This was the first battle in which
the whole regiment had been engaged, and here they evinced a coolness
and true soldiery spirit which inspired the officers in command with that
confidence which subsequent battle scenes satisfactorily proved was not
unfounded.
" The road being now open, the entire command proceeded to Fort
Gibson, where it arrived on the evening of the 5th of July, 1863. On
the 16th of July the entire force at Fort Gibson, under command of
Gen. Blunt, moved upon the enemy, about six thousand strong, com¬
manded by Gen. Cooper, and encamped at Honey Springs, twenty miles
south of Fort Gibson. Our forces came upon the enemy on the morning
of the 17th of July, aud after a sharp and bloody engagement of two
hours' duration, the enemy was totally defeated, with a loss of four hun¬
dred killed and wounded, and one hundred prisoners. At the height of
the engagement, Gen. Blunt ordered Colonel Williams to move his regi¬
ment against that portion of the enemy's line held by the 29th and 30th
Texas regiments and a rebel battery, with directions to charge them if
he thought he could carry and hold the position. The regiment was
moved at a shoulder arms, pieces loaded and bayonets fixed, under a
sharp fire, to within forty paces of the rebel lines, without firing a shot.
The regiment then halted and poured into their ranks a well directed vol¬
ley of ' buck and ball' from the entire line, such as to throw them into
perfect confusion, from which they could not immediately recover. Col.
Williams' intention was, after the delivery of this volley, to charge their
line and capture their battery, which the effect of this volley had doubt¬
less rendered it possible for him to accomplish. But he was at that in¬
stant rendered insensible from gunshot wounds, and the next officer in
rank, Lieutenant-Colonel Bowles, not being aware of his intentions, the
project was not fully carried out. Had the movement been made as con¬
templated, the entire rebel line must have been captured. As it was,
most of the enemy escaped, receiving a lesson, however, which taught
them not to despise on the battle field the race they had long tyrannized
over as having 'no rights which a white man was bound to respect.'
' Colonel Williams says:
•I had loner been of the opinion that this race had a right to kill rebels, and this
day proved their capacity for the work. Forty prisoners and one battle flag fell into
the hands of my regiment on this field.'
"The loss to the regiment in this engagement was five killed and
