The Army of the Cumberland.
composed of tall men, the flanking companies of men of medium height,
while the little men were sandwiched between. The effect was excellent in
every way, and made the regiment quite unique. It was not uncommon
to have strangers who saw it parade for the first time, declare that the
men were all of one size.
" In six weeks three companies were filled, uniformed, armed, and had
been taught many soldierly ways. They had been drilled in the facings,
in the manual of arms, and in some company movements.
"November 20th, Gen. G. H. Thomas commanding the Department
of the Cumberland, ordered six companies to Bridgeport, Alabama, un¬
der command of Major H. C. Corbin. I was left at Gallatin to complete
the organization of the other four companies. When the six companies
were full, I was mustered in as Lieutenant-Colonel. The complete organ¬
ization of the regiment occupied about two months, being finished by
Jan. 1st, 1864. The field, staff and company officers were all white men.
All the non-commissioned officers,—Hospital Steward, Quartermaster,
Sergeant, Sergeant-Major, Orderlies, Sergeants and Corporals were col¬
ored. They proved very efficient, and had the war continued two years
longer, many of them would have been competent as commissioned
officers.
" When General Paine left Gallatin, I was senior officer and had com¬
mand of the post and garrison, which included a few white soldiers besides
my own troops. Colored soldiers acted as pickets, and no citizen was
allowed to pass our lines either into the village or out, without a proper
permit. Those presenting themselves without a pass were sent to head¬
quarters under guard. Thus many proud Southern slave-holders found
themselves marched through the street, guarded by those who three
months before had been slaves. The negroes often laughed over these
changed relations as they sat around their camp fires, or chatted to¬
gether while off duty, but it was very rare that any Southerner had rea¬
son to complain of any unkind or uncivil treatment from a colored
soldier.
" About the first of January occurred a few days of extreme cold
weather, which tried the men sorely. One morning after one of the most
severe nights, the officers coming in from picket, marched the men to
headquarters, and called attention to their condition: their feet were
frosted and their hands frozen. In some instances the skin on their fin¬
gers had broken from the effects of ftie cold, and it was sad to see their
sufferings. Some of them never recovered from the effects of that night,
yet they bore it patiently and uncomplainingly.
"An incident occurred while I was still an officer in a white regiment,
that illustrates the curious transition through which the negroes were
passing. I had charge of a company detailed to guard a wagon train
out foraging. Early one morning, just as we were about to resume our
march, a Kentucky lieutenant rode up to me, saluted, and said he had
some runaway negroes whom he had arrested to send back to their mas¬
ters, but as he was ordered away, he would turn them over to me. (At
