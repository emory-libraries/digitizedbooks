History of th!e Black Phalanx.
I will shoot you, old friend.'
'Question. Did you see anybody else shot? 'Answer. Yes, sir; they
just called them out like dogs, and shot them down. I reckon they shot
about fifty, white and black, right there. They nailed some black ser¬
geants to the logs, and set the logs on fire.
1 Question. When did you see that ? ' Answer. When I went there
in the morning I saw them; they were burning all together. "
'Question. Did they kill them before they burned them? 'Answer.
No, sir, they nailed them to the logs; drove the nails right through
their hands.
'Question. How many did you see in that condition? 'Answer,
Some four or five; I saw two white men burned.
' Question. Was there any one else there who Baw that? Answer. I
reckon there was; I could not tell who.
' Question. When was it that you saw them ? 'Answer. I saw them
in the morning after the fight; some of them were burned almost in two.
I could tell they were white men, because they were whiter than the col¬
ored men.
'Question. Did you notice how they were nailed? 'Answer. I saw
one nailed to the side of a house; he looked like he was nailed right
through his wrist. I was trying then to get to the boat when I saw it.
'Question. Did you see them kill any white men? 'Answer. They
killed some eight or nine there. I reckon they killed more than twenty
after it was all over; called them out from under the hill, and shot them
down. They would call out a white man and shoot him down, and call
out a colored man and shoot him down; do it just as fast as they could
make their guns go off.
' Question. Did you see any rebel officers about there when this was
going on? 'Answer. Yes, sir; old Forrest was one.
'Question. Did you know Forrest? 'Answer^ Yes, sir; he was a
little bit of a man. I had seen him before at Jackson.
'Question. Are you sure he was there when this was going on? 'An¬
swer. Yes, sir.
' Question. Did you see any other officers that you knew ? 'Answer.
I did not know any other but him. There were some two or three more
officers came up there.
'Question did you see any buried there? 'Answer. Yes, sir; they
buried right smart of them. They buried a great many secesh, and a
great many of our folks. I think they buried more secesh than our folks.
'Question. How did they bury them? 'Answer. They buried the
secesh over back of the fort, all except those on Fort hill; them they
buried up on top of the hill where the gunboats shelled them.
'Question. Did they bury any alive? 'Answer. I heard the gun'
boat men say they dug two out who were alive.
'Question. You did not see them? 'Answer. No, sir.
'What company did you fight with? 'Answer. I went right into
the fort and fought there.
