History of the Black Phalanx.
The confederate thirst for "nigger" blood seemed to
have been no stronger in Kentucky than in other Depart¬
ments, but it does appear, for some reason, that Kentucky
and northern Mississippi were selected by the confederate
generals, Pillow and Forrest, as appropriate sections in
which to particularly vent their spite. The success of
Forrest at Fort Pillow rather strengthened General Beau-
ford's inhumanity. He commanded a portion of Pillow's
forces which appeared before Columbus the day after the
Fort Pillow massacre, and in the following summons de¬
manded its surrender:
" To the Commander of the United States Forces, Columbus, Ky
"Fully capable of taking Columbus and its garrison, I desire to
avoid shedding blood. I therefore demand the unconditional surrender
of the forces under your command. Should you surrender, the negroes
in arms will be returned to their masters. Should I be compelled to take
the place by force, no quarter will be shown negro troops whatever;
white troops will be treated as prisoners of war.
"I am, sir, yours,
A. Beatjford, Brig. Gen."
Colonel Lawrence, of the 34th New Jersey, declined to
surrender, and drove the enemy off, who next appeared in
Paducah, but retired without making an assault upon
the garrison.

Union City to Forrest, on the 16th of March, so incensed
the commander of the Department that a strong force
was organized, and in command of General S. D. Sturgis,
started, on the 30th of April, in pursuit of Forrest and
his men, but did not succeed in overtaking him. A few
weeks later, General Sturgis, with a portion of his former
force, combined with that of General Smith's,—just re¬
turning from the Red River (Banks) fiasco,—again went in
pursuit of General Forrest. At Guntown, on the 10th of
June, Sturgis' cavalry, under General Grierson, came up
with the enemy, charged upon them, and drove them back
upon their infantry posted near Brice's Cross Roads. Gen¬
eral Grierson, needing support, sent back for the infantry,
which was several miles in his rear. The day was intense¬
ly hot, and the roads, from constant rains, in very bad
