History of the Black Phalanx.
Federal column, in command of the train guard, and hence passed over
the ground on the way to the battle-field after the balance of the army
had passed, and am able to speak advisedly of the extreme exhaustion
of the infantry, as I passed large numbers entirely prostrated by heat
and fatigue, who did not reach the field of battle and must have fallen
into your hands after the engagement."
[General Sturgis' Report, No. 2.1
"Memphis, Tenn., June 24,1864.
" Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the opera¬
tions of the expedition which marched from near La Fayette, Tenn.,
under my command on the 2nd instant. This expedition was organized
and fitted out under the supervision of the major general commanding
the District of West Tennessee and I assumed command of it on the
morning of the 2nd of June, near the town of La Fayette, Tenn., in pur¬
suance of Special Orders, No, 38, dated Headquarters, District of West
Tennessee, Memphis, May 31, 1864, and which were received by me on
the 1st inst. The strength of the command in round numbers was about
8,000 men,' (which included the following Phalanx regiments: 59th
Regt., 61st Regt., 68th Regt., Battery 1,2nd Artillery, (Light,) 2 pieces.)
" My supply train, carrying rations for 18 days, consisted of 181
wagons, which with the regimental wagons made up a train of some 250
wagons. My instructions were substantially as follows, viz: To pro¬
ceed to Corinth, Mississippi by way of Salem aud Ruckersville, capture
any force that might be there, then proceed south, destroying the Mobile
and Ohio Railroad to Tupelo and Okolona and as far as possible
towards Macon and Columbus with a portion of my force, thence to
Grenada and back to Memphis. A discretion was allowed me as to the
details of the movement where circumstances might arise which could
not have been anticipated in my instructions. Owing to some misunder¬
standing on the part of the quartermaster, as to the point on the Mem¬
phis and Charleston Railroad at which some forage was to have been
deposited from the cars, there was some little delay occasioned in getting
the column in motion.
" The following incidents of the march are taken from the journal
kept from day to day by one of my staff, Capt. W. C. Rawolle, A. D. C.
and A. A. A. G.:
"'Wednesday, June 1st.—Expedition started from Memphis and
White's Station toward LaFayette.
"'Thursday, June 2nd.—The general and staff left Memphis on the
5 o'clock A. m. train and established headquarters at Leaks' House, near
LaFayette, and assumed command. Cavalry moved to the intersection of
State line and Early Grove roads, six miles from La Fayette. It rained
at intervals all day and part of the night.
"'Friday, June 3rd.—Ordered the cavalry to move to within three
four miles of Salem. Infantry marched to Lamar, 18 miles from LaFay¬
ette. Owing to the heavy rains during the day and the bad condition of
