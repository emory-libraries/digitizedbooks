The War of 1812.
73
The persons who deserted from the Melampus, then
lying in Hampton Roads, were William Ware, Daniel Mar¬
tin, John Strachan, John Little and Ambrose Watts.
Within a month from their escape from the Melampus, the
first three of these deserters offered themselves for enlist¬
ment, and were received on board the Chesapeake, then at
Norfolk, Ya, preparing for sea. The British consul at
Norfolk, being apprized of the circumstance, wrote a let¬
ter to the American naval officer, requesting the men to
be returned. With this request, the officer refused to com¬
ply, and the British lost no time in endeavoring to pro¬
cure an order from the American government for their
surrender. On receipt of the application, the Secretary
of the Navy ordered an examination into the charac¬
ters and claims of the men in question. The examination
resulted in proof that the three negroes, Ware, Martin
and Strachan were natives of America. The two former
had "protections," or notarial certificates of their citizen¬
ship;* Strachan had no "protection," but asserted that
he lost it previous to his escape. Such being the circum¬
stances, the government refused to give the men up, insist¬
ing that they were American citizens, and though, they
had served in the British navy, they were pressed into the
service and had a right to desert it.
The Chesapeake was one of the finest of the frigates in
the American Navy, and after receiving an outfit requir¬
ing six months to complete at the Gosport Navy Yard,
at Norfolk, Ya., started for the Mediterranean. The Eng¬
lish frigate Leopard, which lay in the harbor at Norfolk
when the Chesapeake sailed, followed her out to sea, hailed
her and sent a letter to her commander, Commodore
James Barron, demanding the surrender of the desert¬
ers. Barron sent a note refusing to comply with the
demand, whereupon the Leopard fired several broadsides
• So indiscriminate were English officers in these outrages, that it sometimes hap¬
pened that black men were seized as English seamen. At that time the public opinion
of the world was such, that few statesmen troubled themselves much about the rights
of negroes. But in another generation, when it proved convenient in the United States
to argue that free negroes had never been citizens, it was remembered that the cabinets
of Jefferson and Madison, in their diplomatic discussions with Great Britain, had beea
willing to argue that the impressment of a free negro was the seizure of an American
citizen.—Bryant's History of the United States.
