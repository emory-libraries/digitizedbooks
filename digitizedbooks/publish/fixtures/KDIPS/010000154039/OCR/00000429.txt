The Phalanx in Virginia.

eighth corps. "We were up bright and early, ready and eager for the
struggle to commence. I had been wishing for something of this sort
to do for some time, to gain the respect of the Army of the Potomac.
You know their former prejudices. At thirty minutes after five, the ball
opened. The mine, with some fifty pieces of artillery, went off almost
instantaneously; at the same time, the white troops, according to the
plan, charged the fort, which they carried, for there was nothing to
oppose them; but they did not succeed in carrying either of the lines of
intrenchments.
" We were held in rear until the development of the movement of
the white troops; but, on seeing the disaster which was about to occur,
we pushed in by1 the flank (for we could go in in no other way to allow
us to get in position); so you see on this failure we had nothing to do
but gain by the flank. A charge in that manner has never proved suc¬
cessful, to my knowledge; when it does, it is a surprise.
" Our men went forward with enthusiasm equal to anything under
different circumstances; but, in going through the fort that had been
blown up, the passage was almost impeded by obstacles thrown up by
the explosion. At the same time, we were receiving a most deadly cross¬
fire from both flanks. At this time, our lieutenant-colonel (E. W. Ross)
fell, shot through the left leg, bravely leading the men. I immediately
assumed command, but only to hold it a few minutes, when I fell, struck
by a piece of shell in the side. Capt. Robinson, from Connecticut, then
took command; and, from all we can learn, he was killed. At this
time, our first charge was somewhat checked, and the men sought cover
in the works. Again our charge was made, but, like the former, unsuc¬
cessful. This was followed by the enemy making a charge. Seeing the
unorganized condition and the great loss of officers, the men fell back to
our own works. Yet a large number still held the fort until two p. m.,
when the enemy charged again, and carried it. That ended the great
attempt to take Petersburg.
"It will be thus seen that the colored troops did not compose the
first assaulting, but the supporting column; and they were not ordered
forward until white troops in greater numbers had made a desperate
effort to carry the rebel works, and had failed. Then the colored troops
were sent in; moved over the broken ground, and up the slope, and
within a short distance of the parapet, in order, and with steady cour¬
age ; but finally broke and retreated under the same fire which just be¬
fore had sent a whole division of white regiments to the right-about. If
there be any disgrace in that, it does not belong exclusively nor mainly
to the negroes. A second attack is far more perilous and unlikely to suc¬
ceed than a first; the enemy having been encouraged by the failure of
the first, and had time to concentrate his forces. And, in this case, there
seems to have been a fatal delay in ordering both the first and second
assault."
