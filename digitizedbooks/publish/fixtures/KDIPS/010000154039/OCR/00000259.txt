Depaktment of the South.
257
The heroic courage displayed by the gallant Phalanx
at the assault upon Fort Wagner was not surpassed by
the Old Guard at Moscow. Major-General Taliaferro
gives this confederate account of the fight, which is espe¬
cially interesting as it shows the condition of affairs in¬
side the fort:
" On the night of the 14th the monster iron-plated frigate New Iron¬
sides, crossed the bar and added her formidable and ponderous battery
to those destined for the great effort of reducing the sullen earthwork
which barred the Federal advance. There were now five monitors, the
Ironsides and a fleet of gunboats and monster hulks grouped together
and only waiting the signal to unite with the land batteries when the en¬
gineers should pronounce them ready to form a cordon of flame around
the devoted work. The Confederates were prepared for the ordeal. For
for fear that communications with the city and the mainland, which was
had by steamboat at night to Cummings' Point should be interrupted,
rations and ordnance stores had been accumulated, but there was trou¬
ble about water. Some was sent from Charleston and wells had been
dug in the sand inside and outside the fort, but it was not good. Sand
bags had been provided and trenching tools supplied sufficient for any
supposed requirement.
" The excitement of the enemy in front after the 10th was manifest
to the Confederates and announced an 'impending crisis.' It became
evident that some extraordinary movement was at hand. The Federal
forces on James Island had been attacked on the morning of the 16th by
General Hagood and caused to retire, Hagood occupying the aban¬
doned positions, and on the 17th the enemy's troops were transferred to
Little Folly and Morris Islands. It has been stated that the key to the
signals employed by the Federals was in possession of General Taliaferro
at this time, and he was thus made acquainted with the intended move¬
ment and put upon his guard. That is a mistake. He had no such di¬
rect information, although it is true that afterwards the key was discov¬
ered and the signals interpreted with as much ease as by the Federals
themselves. The 18th of July was the day determined upon by the Fed¬
eral commanders for the grand attempt which, if successful, would level
the arrogant fortress and confuse it by the mighty power of their giant
artillery with the general mass of surrounding sand hills, annihilate its
garrison or drive them into the relentless ocean, or else consign them to
the misery of hostile prisons.
" Tlje day broke beautifully, a gentle breeze slightly agitated the
balmy atmosphere, and with rippling dimples beautified the bosom of
the placid sea. All nature was serene and the profoundest peace held
dominion over all the elements. The sun, rising with the early splendors
of his midsummer glory, burnished with golden tints the awakening
ocean, and flashed his reflected light back from the spires of the beleag-
