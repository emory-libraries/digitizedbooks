History of the Black Phalanx.
conducive to ingenuity, so the idea soon became a plan and a conspiracy.
While the new guard had stacked arms in the open square preparatory
to mounting, some ten or twelve officers, under the lead of Col. Ralston,
the powerful head of some New York regiment, were to ask for exit under
pretense of getting water, and then to overpower the opposing sentries,
while the balance of the prisoners, previously drawn up in line at the
head of the short staircase leading direct to the exit door, were to rush
down into the square, seize the stacked arms and march through the
Confederacy to the Union lines—perhaps!
'Among the ten or twelve psuedo-water-carriers—the forlorn hope—
were Col. Ralston, Capt. Cook, of the Ninth, and one or two of the
Seventh—Capt. Weiss and Lieut. Spinney. On the guard opening the
door for egress, Col. Ralston and one of the Seventh threw themselves on
the first man, a powerful six-footer, and floored him. At the same mo¬
ment, however, another guard with great presence of mind, slammed the
door and turned the key, and that before five officers could descend the
short staircase. The attempt was now a failure. One of the guards on
the outside of the building took deliberate aim throngh the open window
at Col. Ralston, who was still engaged with the struggling fellow, and
shot him through the bowels. Col. Ralston died a lingering and painful
death after two or three days. Less true bravery than his has been
highly sung in verse.
"'This attempt could not but sharpen the discipline of the prison,
but soon the natural humanity of the commandant, Col. Smith, now be¬
lieved to be Chief Engineer of the Baltimore Bridge Company, asserted
itself, and things went on as before. Two incidents may, however, be
mentioned in this connection, whose asperities time has removed, leav¬
ing nothing but their salient grotesque features.
" 'Immediately after the occurrence, an unlimited supply of dry-salted
codfish was introduced. This being the first animal food for weeks, was
greedily devoured in large quantities, mostly raw—producing a raging
thirst. The water supply was now curtailed to a few bucketsful, but
even these few drops of the precious fluid were mostly wasted in the me¬
lee for their possession. The majority of the contestants retired disap¬
pointed to muse on the comforts of the Sahara Desert, and as the stories
about tapping camels recurred to them, suggestive glances were cast at
the more fortunate rivals. After a few days, conspicuous for the sparing
enjoyment of salt cod, the water supply was ordered unlimited. An im¬
mediate 'eorner' in the Newfoundland staple took place, the stock being
actively absorbed by bona fide investors, who found that it bore water¬
ing with impunity.

" 'At the beginning of February, 1865, thirty boxes of provisions,
etc., from friends in the North arrived for the prisoners. The list of own¬
ers was anxiously scanned and the lucky possessor would not have ex¬
changed for the capital prize in the Havana lottery. The poor fellows of
