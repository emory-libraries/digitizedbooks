The War of 1775.

neither in reason nor experience; and an unwillingness to part company
with property of so valuable a kind will furnish a thousand arguments to
show the impracticability or pernicious tendency of a scheme which
requires such a sacrifice. But it should be considered, that, if we do not
make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will; and that the
best way to counteract the the temptations they will hold out will be to
offer them ourselves. An essential part of the plan is to give them their
freedom with their muskets. This will secure their fidelity, animate their
courage, and, I believe, will have a good influence upon those who re¬
main, by opening a door to their emancipation. This circumstance, I
confess has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of the
project; for ttie dictates of humanity and true policy, equally interest
me in favor of this unfortunate class of men."
The patriotic zeal of Col. Laurens for the accomplish¬
ment of his design was earnest and conscientious. He
wrote to his friend Hamilton in these words:
" Ternant will relate to you how many violent struggles I have had
between duty and inclination—how much my heart was with you, while
I appeared to be most actively employed here. But it appears to me,
that I should be inexcusable in the light of a citizen, if I did not continue
my utmost efforts for carrying the plan of the black levies into execu¬
tion, while there remains the smallest hope of success."
The condition of the colonies and the Continental
army at that time was critical in the extreme. The cam¬
paign of 1779 had closed gloomily for the Americans.
The British had not only been active in raiding in Vir¬
ginia and destroying property, but in organizing negro
troops. Lord Dunmore, as we have seen, as early as
November, 1775, had issued a proclamation, inviting the
negroes to join the Royal forces, to which a great many
slaves responded, *and were organized into companies. A
regiment had been organized by the British on Long
Island in 177G, and now, Sir Henry Clinton invited them
by the following proclamation:
"By his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton, K. B., General and Com¬
mander-in-Chief of all his Majesty's Forces, within the Colonies lying on
the Atlantic Ocean, from Nova Scotia to West Florida, inclusive, &c., &c.
PROCLAMATION.
"Whereas the enemy have adopted a practice of enrolling Negroes
among their Troops, I do hereby give notice That all Negroes taken in
arms, or upon any military Duty, shall be purchased for the public ser¬
vice at a stated Price; the money to be paid to the Captors.
