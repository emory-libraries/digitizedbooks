The Phalanx in Virginia.

until the 5th they resumed the march, fighting and run¬
ning, until, at Appomattox they gave up and surrendered.
Major Alexandria S. Johnson of the 116th Phalanx Regi¬
ment thus relates the story in part which the Phalanx
brigade took in the memorable movement of the two
armies to Appomatto^. He says:
"As a participant in these events I will speak merely of what came
under my own observation. The One Hundred and Sixteenth (colored)
Infantry, in which I commanded a company, belonged to the Third
Brigade, Second Division of the Twenty-fifth Army Corps, and during
the winter of 1864-65 held the lines on Chapin's farm, the left resting
on Fort Burnham. The division was commanded by Major-General
Birney. The winter was passed in endeavoring to get the troops in as
high a state of discipline as possible by constant drill and watchful
training. When the spring opened we had the satisfaction of feeling
that they were the equal, as soldiers, of most of the white troops. They
were a contented body, being well fed and clothed, and they took delight
in their various duties. The news of the capture of Savannah by Sher¬
man and the defeat of Hood at Nashville had a cheering effect upon the
whole command, and we looked forward with confidence that the end
was drawing near.
" On the night of the 26th of March our division silently left the lines
on Chapin's farm, and marching to the rear some three miles went into
bivouac. On the night of the 27th we crossed the James on muffled
pontoons, and after a weary march arrived at Hatcher's Run at day¬
break of the 28th. Crossing the original lines of breastworks we built
new breastworks some two hundred yards in advance and bivouacked
in the pine woods awaiting events. Sheridan at this time was operating
on the Confederate right flank. The news of his decisive victory at Five
Forks and of the complete turning of the enemy's flank was the immedi¬
ate cause of a verbal order, given to company commanders by our
colonel on the afternoon of April 1st, to advance on the lines in our
front at dawn on the following day. That night the Union artillery
opened along the whole line. Hissing and bursting shells from Appo¬
mattox river to Hatcher's Run filled in a scene never to be forgotten by
those who witnessed it. It was as if demons incarnate were holding a
jubilee. As far as the eye could reach there was one blaze of fiery shot.
The world has seldom seen its like. "Where our brigade was to operate
was a dense wilderness of pines with matted -underbrush, but in the
morning it looked as though a sirocco had kissed it.
" With the dawn of day the brigade was in line of battle. Not a
breath of air was stirring. A misty vapor shed its gloom and hung like
a pall among the tree-tops. The silk covers were taken from our flags,
but their folds hung lazily alongthe staff when the command, 'Forward!
guide centre! march!' was given. At first slashed timber and brush
