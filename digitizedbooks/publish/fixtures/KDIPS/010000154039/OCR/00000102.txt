History of the Black Phalanx.
With this yiew, the whole slave population was
brought to the assistance of the Confederate Government,
and thereby caught the very first hope of freedom. An
innate reasoning taught the negro that slaves could not
be relied upon to fight for their own enslavement. To get
to the breastworks was but to get a chance to run to the
Yankees; and thousands of those whose elastic step kept
time with the martial strains of the drum and fife, as they
marched on through city and town, enroute to the front,
were not elated with the hope of Southern success, but were
buoyant with the prospects of reaching the North. The
confederates found it no easy task to watch the negroes
and the Yankees too; their attention could be given to

after months by the negro troops as they marched along
through Dixie:
"McClellan went to Richmond with two hundred thousand braves,
He said, ' keep back the niggers and the Union he would save."
Little Mac. he had his way, still the Union is in tears,
And they call for the help of the colored volunteers."
The first two lines expressed the sentiment at the time,
not only of the Army of the Potomoc, but the army com¬
manders everywhere, with the exceptions named. The
administration winked at the enforcement of the -fugitive
slave bill by the soldiers engaged in capturing and return¬
ing the negroes coming into the Union lines * Undoubted¬

the war from its rightful channel, or in other words,—in
