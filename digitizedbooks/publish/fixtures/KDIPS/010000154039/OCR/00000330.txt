with care and hunger; there was no brightening of the countenance or
lighting up of the eye, to indicate a thought of anything beyond a pain¬

there was scarcely a ray of intelligence left.
" Every preparation had been made for their reception in anticipa¬
tion of the arrival of the steamer, and immediately upon her being made
fast to the wharf the paroled men were landed and taken immediately to
the hospital, where, after receiving a warm bath, they were furnished
with a suitable supply of new clothing, and received all those other at¬
tentions which their sad condition demanded. Of the whole number,
there are perhaps filty to one hundred who, in a week or ten days, will be
in a convalescent state, but the others will very slowly regain their lost
health.
" That our soldiers, when in the hands of the rebels, are starved to
death, cannot be denied. Every return of the flag-of-truce boat from
City Point brings us too many living and dying witnesses to admit of a

can believe it; and while a practice so shocking to humanity is persisted
in by the rebel authorities, I would very respectfully urge that retalia¬
tory measures be at once instituted by subjecting the officers we now
hold as prisoners of war to a similar treatment.

gave me to ma,ke a hasty inspection of Camp Parole, and I am happy to
report that I found it in every branch in a most commendable condition.
The men all seemed to be cheerful and in fine health, and the police inside
and out was excellent. Colonel Root, the commanding officer, deserves
much credit for the very satisfactory condition to which he has brought
his command.

* General Brisbin, in his account of the expedition which, in the "Winter of 1864, left
Bean Station, Tenn., under command of General Stoneman, for the purpose of destroy¬
ing the confederate Salt Works in West Virginia, says the confederates after capturing
some of the soldiers of the Sixth Phalanx Cavalry Begiment, butchered them. His
statement is as follows:
" For the last two days a force of Confederate cavalry, under Witcher, had been fol¬
lowing our command picking up stragglers and worn-out horses in our rear. Part of
our troops were composed of negroes and these the Confederates killed as fast as they
