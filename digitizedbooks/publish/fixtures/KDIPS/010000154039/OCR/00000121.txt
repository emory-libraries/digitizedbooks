troops an indispensable quantity to the success of his
expeditions; consequently lie laid aside his prejudice, and
endeavored to out-Herod (jen. Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant
General of the Army,—who in March had been dispatched
on a military inspection tour through the armies of the
West and the Mississippi Valley, and also to organize a
number of negro regiments*—by issuing in May the fol¬
lowing order:
Corps d'Afrique.
GENERAL ORDERS! HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF THE GULP,
No. 40. / 19th Abmy Corps,
Opelousas, May 1,1863.
The Major General commanding the Department proposes the organization of a
corps d'armee of colored troops, to be designated as the "Corps d'Afrique." It will
consist ultimately of eighteen regiments, representing all arms—Infantry, Artillery,
and Cavalry, organized in three Divisions of three Brigades each, with appropriate
corps of Engineers and flying Hospitals for each Division. Appropriate uniforms, and
the graduation of pay to correspond with value of services, will be hereafter awarded.
In the field, the efficiency of every corps depends upon the influence of its officers
upon the troops engaged, and the practicable limits of one direct command is gener¬
ally estimated at one thousand men. The most eminent military historians and com¬
manders, among others Thiers and Chambray, express the opinion, upon a full review
of the elements of military power, that the valor of the soldier is rather acquired than
natural. Nations whose individual heroism is undisputed, have failed as soldiers in the
field. The European and American continents exhibit instances of this character, and
the military prowess of every nation may be estimated by the centuries it has devoted
to military contest, or the traditional passion of its people for military glory. With a
race unaccustomed to military service, much more depends on the immediate influence
of officers upon individual members, than with those that have acquired more or less
of warlike. habits and spirit by centuries of contest. It is deemed best, therefore, in
the organization of the Corps d'Afrique, to limit the regiments to the smallest number
of men consistent with efficient service in the field, in order to secure the most thorough
instruction and discipline, and the largest influence of the officers over the troops. At
first they will be limited to five hundred men. The average of American regiments is
less than that number.
The Commanding General desires to detail for temporary or permanent duty the
best officers of the army, for the organization, instruction and discipline of this corps.
With their aid, he is confident that the corps will render important service to the Gov¬
ernment. It is not established upon any dogma of equality or other theory, but as a
practical and sensible matter of business. The Government makes use of mules, horses,
uneducated and educated white men, in the defense of its institutions. Why should
not the negro contribute whatever is in his power for the cause in which he is as deeply
interested as other men? We may properly demand from him whatever service he can
render. The chief defect in organizations of this character has arisen from incorrect
ideas of the officers in command. Their discipline has been lax, and in some cases the
conduct of the regiments unsatisfactory and discreditable. Controversies unnecessary
and injurious to the service have arisen between them and other troops. The organiza¬
tion proposed will reconcile and avoid many of these troubles.
Officers and soldiers will consider the exigencies of the service in this Department,
and the absolute necessity of appropriating every element of power to the support of
the Government. The prejudices or opinions of men are in nowise involved. The co¬
operation and active support of all officers and men, and the nomination of fit men
from the ranks, and from the lists of non-commissioned and commissioned officers, are
respectfully solicited from the Generals commanding the respective Divisions.

* General The exigencies of the service require that an inspection shou ld be made
of the Armies, military posts and military operations inthe West; you will therefore
make arrangements immediately to perform that service. Without entering into any mi¬
nute details? I beg to direct your attention to the following subjects of mvestigation
First On arriving at Cairo, you will make a careful examination of the military
condition of that post, in the various branches of service, and report to. this De¬
partment, the result of your investigation, suggesting whatever in your opinion, the
service may require. You will observe particularly the condition of that classof p<ovu¬
lationknown as contrabands; the manner in which they are received, provided for and
treated by the military authorities, and give such directions to the Commissary and
Quartermaster Departments, and to the officers commanding, as shall, in your judge-
