should be freed. It would be neither wisdom nor justice, in my opinion,
to require them to serve as slaves. The best course to pursue, it seems
to me, is to call for such as are willing to come with the consent of their
owners. Impressment or draft would not be likely to bring out the best
class, and the use of coercion would make the measure distasteful to
them and to their owners. I have no doubt if Congress would author¬
ize their reception into service, and empower the President to call upon
individuals or States for such as they are willing to contribute with the
condition of emancipation to all enrolled, a sufficient number would be
forthcoming to enable us to try the experiment.
"If it proves successful, most of the objections to the matter would
disappear, and if individuals still remained unwilling to send their
negroes to the army, the force of public opinion in the States would
soon bring about such legislation as would remove all obstacles.
I think the matter should be left as far as possible to the people and the
States, which alone can legislate as the necessities of this particular ser¬
vice may require. As to the mode of organizing them, it should be left
as free from restraint as possible. Experience will suggest the best
course, and would be inexpedient to trammel the subject with provisions
that might in the end prevent the adoption of reforms, suggested by
actual trial.
" With great respect,
"ROBERT E. LEE, General."
Meanwhile the measure, to forward which this letter
was written, was progressing very slowly. J. B. Jones,
clerk of the War Department of the Confederate Govern¬
ment, entered in his diary from day to day such scraps of
information as he was able to glean about the progress
of this important matter. These entries are significant
of the anxiety of this critical time. Under February 14th
we find this entry:
" Yesterday some progress was made with the measure of 200,000
negroes for the army. Something must be done and soon."
" February 16th.—Did nothing yesterday; it is supposed, however,
that the bill recruiting negro troops will pass. I fear when it is too late."
" February 17th.—A letter from General Lee to General Wise is pub¬
lished, thanking the latter's brigade for resolutions recently adopted
declaring that they would consent to gradual emancipation for the sake
of independence and peace. From all signs slavery is doomed. But if
200,000 negro recruits can be made to fight and can be enlisted, Gen¬
eral Lee may maintain the war very easily and successfully, and the
powers at Washington may soon become disposed to abate the hard
terms of peace now exacted."
" February 21st.—The negro bill has passed one house and will pass
the other to-day, but the measure may come too late. The enemy is
enclosing us on all sides with great vigor and rapidity."
