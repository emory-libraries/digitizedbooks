The War of 1775.

Tories prevented its success. Notwithstanding, hundreds
of colored men, slave and free, at the South, not only fol¬
lowed the army but in every engagement took an active
part on the side of the colonist. They were not enrolled
and mustered into the army, it is true, but they rendered
important service to the cause.
The caste prejudice now so strong in the country was
then in its infancy. A white man at that time lived with
a colored woman without fear of incurring the ostracism
of his neighbors, and with the same impunity he lived with
an Indian Squaw. So common was this practice, that in
order to correct it laws were passed forbidding it. The
treatment of the slaves was not what it came to be after
the war, nor had the spirit of resentment been stifled in
them as it was subquently. Manifestations of their cour¬
age and manliness were not wanting when injustice was
attempted to be practiced against them, consequently the
spirit and courage with which they went into the conflict
were quite equal to that of the whites, who were ever ready
to applaud them for deeds of daring. It is only through
this medium that we have discovered the meed of praise
due thQ little Phalanx, which linked its fortune with the
success of the American army, and of whom the follow¬
ing interesting facts can now be recorded.
It is well for the negro and for his decendants in Amer¬
ica, cosmopolitan as it is, that his race retains its dis¬
tinctive characteristicts, color and features, otherwise
they would not have, as now, a history to hand down to
posterity so gloriously patriotic and interesting. His
amalgamation with other races is attributable to the
relation which it bore to them, although inter-marriage
was not allowed. By the common consent of his enslav¬
ers, he was allowed to live clandestinely with the women
of his own color; sometimes from humane considera¬
tions, sometimes from a standpoint of gain, but always
as a slave or a subject of slave code. Reduced from his
natural state of freedom by his misfortune in tribal war,
to that of a slave, and then transported by the consent
of his captors and enemies to these shores, and sold
