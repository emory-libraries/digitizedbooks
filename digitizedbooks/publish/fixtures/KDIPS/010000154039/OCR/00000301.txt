us in full sight, apparently bent on mischief. Pointing to the advancing
column, I said, as I passed along the line, ' Boys, it looks very much like
fight; kegp cool, do your duty.' They seemed full of glee, and replied
with great enthusiasm: 1 Colonel, dey can't whip us, dey nebber get de
ole 14th out of heah, nebber.' ' Nebber, drives us away widout a mighty
lot of dead men,' &c., &c.
"When Forest learned that Rousseau was re-enforced by infantry, he
did not stop to ask the color of the skin, but after testing our line, and
finding it unyielding, turned to the east, and struck over toward Mur-
freesboro.
" An incident occurred here, illustrating the humor of the colored
soldier. A spent ball struck one of the men on the side of the head,
passed under the scalp, and making nearly a circuit of the skull, came
Out on the other side. His comrades merrily declared that when the ball
struck him, it sang out 'too thick' and passed on.
"As I was walking with my adjutant down toward the picket line, a
ball struck the ground immediately in front of us, about four feet away,
but it was so far spent as to be harmless. We picked it up and carried it
along.
" Our casualties consisted of a few men slightly wounded. We had
not had a battle, but it was for us a victory, for our troops had stood
face to face with a triumphant force of Southern cavalry, and stopped
their progress. They saw that they had done what Rousseau's veterans
could not do. Having traveled 462 miles, we returned to Chattanooga,
feeling that we had gained valuable experience, and we eagerly awaited
the next opportunity for battle, which was not long delayed.
"Decatur, Ala.—Our next active service was at Decatur, Alabama. *
Hood, with his veteran army that had fought Sherman so gallantly
from Chattanooga to Atlanta, finding that his great antagonest had
started southward and seaward, struck out boldly himself for Nashville.
Oct. 27th I reported to General R. S. Granger, commanding at Decatur.
His little force was closely besieged by Hood's army, whose right rested
on the Tennessee river below the town, and whose left extended far be¬
yond our lines, on the other side of the town. Two companies of my
regiment were stationed on the opposite side of the river from Hood's
right, and kept up an annoying musketry fire. Lieutenant Gillett, of
Company G, was mortally wounded by a cannon ball, and some of the
enlisted men were hurt. One private soldier in Company B, who had
taken position in a tree as sharpshooter, had his right arm broken by a
ball. Captain Romeyn said to him, 'You would better come down from
there, go to the rear, and find the surgeon.' ' Oh no, Captain!' he replied,
*1 can fire with my left arm,' and so he did.
" Another soldier of Company B, was walking along the road, when
hearing an approaching cannon ball, he dropped flat upon the ground,
and was almost instantly well nigh covered with the dirt, plowed up by
it, as it struck the ground near by. Captain Romeyn, who witnessed the
incident, and who was greatly amused by the fellow's trepidation,
