Histoey of the Black Phalanx.
mand of these troops exclusively. By November these
three regiments were in the field, where in course of time
they often met their former masters face to face and ex¬
changed shots with them. The pro-slavery men of the
North and their newspapers endeavored to make the sol¬
diers in the field believe that the negroes would not fight;
while not only the papers and the soldiers, but many offi¬
cers, especially those from the West Point Academy, de¬
nounced General Butler for organizing the regiments. Gen¬
eral Weitzel, to whose command these regiments were
assigned in an expedition up the river, objected to them,
and asked Butler to relieve him of the command of the
expedition. Butler wrote him in reply:
"You say that in these organizations you have no confidence. As your reading
must have made you aware, General Jackson entertained a different opinion upon that
subject. It was arranged between the commanding general and yourself, that the col¬
ored regiments should be employed in guarding the railroad. "Sou don't complain, in
your report, that they either failed in this duty, or that they have acted otherwise than
correctly and obediently to the commands of their officers, or that they have commit¬
ted any outrage or pillage upon the inhabitants. The general was aware of your opin¬
ion, that colored men will not fight. You have failed to show, by the conduct of these
free men, so far, anything to sustain that opinion. And the general cannot see why
you should decline the command, especially as you express a willingness to go forward
to meet the only organized enemy with your brigade alone, without farther support.
The commanding general cannot see how the fact that they are guarding your line of
communication by railroad, can weaken your defense. He must, therefore, look to the
other reasons stated by you, for an explanation of your declining the command.
"You say that since the arrival of the negro regiment you have seen symptoms of
a servile insurrection. But as the only regiment that arrived there got there as soon,
as your own command, of course the appearance of such symptoms is since their
arrival.
"Have you not mistaken the cause? Is it the arrival of a negro regiment, or is it
the arrival of United States troops, carrying by the act of congress freedom to this
servile race? Did you expect to march into that country, drained, as you say it is, by
conscription of all its able-bodied white men, without leaving the negroes free to
show symptoms of servile insurrection? Does not this state of things arise from the
very fact of war itself? You are in a country where now the negroes outnumber the
whites ten to one, and these whites are in rebellion against the government, or in ter¬
ror seeking its protection. Upon reflection, can you doubt that the same state of
things would have arisen without the presence of a colored regiment? Did you not see
symptoms of the same things upon the plantations here upon our arrival, although
under much less favorable circumstances for revolt?
"You say that the prospect of such an insurrection is heart-rending, and that you
cannot be responsible for it. The responsibility rests upon those who have begun and
carried out this war, and who have stopped at no barbarity, at no act of outrage,
upon the citizens and soldiers of the United States. You have forwarded me the rec¬
ords of a pretended court-martial, showing that seven men of one of your regiments,
who enlisted here m the Eighth Vermont, who had surrendered themselves prisoners of
^r,ai\v^r?re m col(i "lood murdered, and, as certain information shows me, required to

prospective servile insurrection. s
