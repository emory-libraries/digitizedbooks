History of the Black Phalanx.
ing of the enrolling acts, and the act calling out the
militia, whereby negroes were enrolled.
In the winter of '64 Gen. Butler began the organiza¬
tion of the Army of the James and the enlistment of
negro troops. A camp was established near Fortress
Monroe, where a great many men enlisted. The Secretary
of War gave permission to the several Northern States to
send agents South, and to enlist negroes to fill up their
quotas of troops needed. Large bounties were then being
paid and many a negro received as much as $500 to
enlist; while many who went as substitutes received even
more than that. The recruiting officers or rather agepts
from the different States established their headquarters
largely within Gen. Butlers departments, where negro vol¬
unteers were frequently secured at a much less price than
the regular bounty offered, the agent putting into his own
pocket the difference, which often amounted to $200 or
even $400 on a single recruit. To correct this wrong,
Gen. Butler issued the following order :
HEADQUARTERS DEP'T. VIRGINIA & NORTH CAROLINA,
GENERAL, ORDERS,\ In the Field, Va., August 4th, 1864.
No. 90. J

"With all the guards which the utmost vigilance and care have thrown around the
recruitment of white soldiers, it is a fact, as lamentable as true, that a large portion of
the recruits have been swindled of part, if not all, of their bounties. Can it be hoped
that the colored man will be better able to protect himself from the infinite ingenuity
of fraud than the white ?
Therefore, to provide for the families of the colored recruits enlisted in this Depart¬
ment—to relieve the United States, as far as may be, from the burden of supporting
the families,—and to insure that at least a portion of the bounty paid to the negro
ehall be received for his use and that of his family;
Jt is ordpred: I—That upon th6 enlistment of any negro recruit into the service of
the United States for three (3) years, by any State agent or other person not enlisting
recruits under the direct authority of the War Department, a sum of one hundred (100)
dollars, or one-third (Va) of the sum agreed to be paid as bounty, shall be paid if the
amount exceeds three times that sum, into the hands of the Superintendent of Recruit¬
ing, or an officer to be designated by him, and in the same proportion for any less
time; and no Mustering Officer will give any certificate or voucher for any negro recruit
mustered into the service of the United States, so that he may be credited to the quota
of any State, or as a substitute, until a certificate is filed with him that the amount
called for by this order has been paid, to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of
Recruiting of the district wherein the recruit was enlisted; but the mustering officer will,
in default of such payment, certify upon the roll that the recruit is not to be credited to
the quota of any State, or as a substitute.
II—The amount as paid to the Superintendent of Recruiting shall be turned over,
on the last day of each month, to the Superintendent of Negro Affairs,to be expended
in aid of the families of negro soldiers in this Department. The certificates filed with
Commissary of Musters will be returned to said Superintendent of Negro Affairs, on
the first day of every month, so that the Superintendent may vouch for the accounts
of the Superintendent of Recruiting, for the amounts received by him.
And the Superintendent of Negro Affairs will account monthly to the Financial
Agent of this Department for the amounts received and expended by him.
III—As there are unfilled colored Regiments in this Department sufficient to receive
all the negro recruits therein, no negro male person above the age of sixteen (16) years
shall be taken out or attempted to be taken out of this Department, either as a recruit'
as officer's servant, or otherwise, in any manner whatever, without a pass from these
Head Quarters. Any officer, Master of Transportation, Provost Marshal, or person,
