History of the Black Phalanx.
upon that memorable occasion, shouting, "The day is
ours!" Peter Salem poured the contents of his gun into
that officer's body, killing him instantly, and checking,
temporarily, the advance of the British. Swett, in his
" Sketches of Bunker Hill Battle," says:
"Major Pitcairn caused the first effusion, of blood at Lexington. In
that battle, his horse was shot under him, while he was separated from
his troops. "With presence of mind he feigned himself slain; his pistols
were taken from his hostlers, and he was left for dead, when he seized the
opportunity and escaped. He appeared at Bunker Hill, and, says the
historian, 'Among those who mounted the works was the gallant Major
Pitcairn, who exultingly cried out, ' The day is ours!' when a black sol¬
dier, named Salem, shot him through a,nd he fell. His agonized son
received him in his arms, and tenderly bore him to the boats.' A contri¬
bution was made in the army for the colored soldier, and he was pre¬
sented to Washington as having performed this feat."
Mr. Aaron White, of Thompson, Conn., in a letter to
George Livermore, Esq., of the Massachusetts Histori¬
cal Society, writes :
"With regard to the black Hero of Bunker Hill, I never knew him
personally, nor did I ever hear from his lips the story of his achieve¬

soldier of the Revolution, who was present at the Bunker Hill Battle,
relate to my father the story of the death of Major Pitcairn. He said
the Major had passed the storm of fire without, and had mounted the
redoubt, when, waving his sword, he commanded, in a loud voice, the
' rebels' to surrender. His sudden appearance, and his commanding air,
at first startled the men immediately before him. They neither answered
nor fired; probably not being exactly certain what was next to be done.
At this critical moment, a negro soldier stepped forward, and, aiming his
musket directly at the Major's bosom, blew him through. My informant
declared that he was so near, that he distinctly saw the act. The story
made quite an impression on my mind. I have frequently heard my
farther relate the story, and have no doubt of its truth. My father on
the day of the battle was a mere child, and witnessed the battle and
burning of Charlestown from Roxbury Hill, sitting on the shoulders of
the Rev. Mr. Jackson, who ^aid to him as he placed him on the ground,
'Now, boy, do you remember this!' Consequently, after such an injunc¬
tion, he would necessarily pay particular attention to anecdotes concern¬
ing the first and only battle he ever witnessed."
Salem was undoubtedly one of the chief heroes of that
ever memorable battle. Orator, historian, poet, all give
