dacious charge—the enemy's repulse, which sweetens victory. And surely
no soldiers can appreciate the final triumph with a keener sense of glad¬
ness than those who fought against such odds as did the Black Phalanx.
Beating down prejudice and upholding the national cause at the same
time, they have inscribed upon their banners every important battle
from April, 1863, to April, 1865.
If what I have written here shall call to your minds, and present

dured on the march, in the bivouac, and in the seething flames of the bat¬
tle's front, my task will have served its purpose. In the name of and afl
a token of the gratitude of a freed race, this book is dedicated to you.
