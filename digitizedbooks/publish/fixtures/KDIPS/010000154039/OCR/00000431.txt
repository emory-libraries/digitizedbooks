The Phalanx in Virginia.

thought it a favorable opportunity to threaten Rich¬
mond, and ordered Hancock with the 2nd, ana Birney
with a part of the 10th Corps, with Gregg's Cavalry, to
attack the confederate works on the north side of the
James, The object was two-fold: to prevent Lee from
re-enforcing Early, confronted by Sheridan's troops; and
likewise to drive the confederates from out their works.
The troops crossed the James on the 13th, the 2d Corps
going to Deep Bottom by transports, the other troops
crossing the river by pontoons, and advancing, found the
enemy in force. Several spirited engagements took place,
after which the main forces withdrew again across the
j iver, to the front of Petersburg. The following account
applies to the brigade as well as the 7th Phalanx Regi¬
ment, from whose record it is extracted:
"During the forenoon of thel4tb the (7th) Regiment acted as reserve,
moving forward occasionally as the line advanced. Most of the work of
the day was done to the right, little being done in the immediate front
except skirmishing. About 5 p. m. a portion of the Seventh and Ninth,
forming line in the edge of some timber, moved across an open field and
charged upon reaching the farther side and captured the enemy's line of
rifle-pits. The companies of the Seventh pushed on some distance fur¬
ther toward their second line, but were met with so severe a fire that
they fell back to the captured line; which was held. This charge, known
as the action of Kingsland Road, was made in fine style. The battalion
of the Seventh was comma'nded by Capt. Weiss—Col. Shaw having been
detailed as Corps Officer of the day, and Lieut.-Col. Haskell being tem¬
porarily in command of the brigade. Our losses were two men killed,
and one officer (Lieut. Eler) and thirty-two men wounded.
"About 10 o'clock p. m., the troops moved down the road to th©
right, and at 1 o'clock Col. Shaw withdrew the pickets of the corps, re-
crossed the pontoons, where we had crossed in the morning, and moved
down the neck. Then followed four hours of the most wearisome night-
marching—moving a few rods at a time and then halting for troops
ahead to get out of the way; losing sight of them and hurrying forward
to catch up; straggling out into the darkness, stumbling and groping
along the rough road, and all the time the rain coming down in a most
provoking, exasperating drizzle. About daylight crossed back to the
north side and halted for coffee, and then moved forward some four
miles and rejoined the corps, taking position behind the crest of a hill.
The Eighth and Twenty-ninth were left in a work on the hill.
" About 3:30 p. m. orders came to pile knapsacks and be ready to
march immediately. A little after 4 o'clock the brigade moved to the
