The Phalanx in Virginia.

and now began the decisive battle. The roar was deafen¬
ing. Night was coming on, and Sheridan was anxious to
carry out Grant's order and "end the matter if possible
to do so." He gave the order, "Charge bayonets!" In
five minutes Picket's outer line was in possession of the
federals. Crawford's division struck them in the flank,
and, with McKenzie's brigade, routed and sent the confed¬

wives and children, yet slaves, behind the enemy's guns:
precious property they are, and guarded like dearest
treasure and even life itself, by an army of slave-holders—
Lee's men, who, with the desperation of demons, vainly
attempted to check the advance of the men of the North,
who, with their lives, defended the Union. The black bri¬
gade wanted to strike one more blow for freedom—for the
freedom of their wives and children—to make one more
charge, and the confederate banner should go down; one
more charge, and the light of Liberty's stars should bla¬

with the dawning of day, came the order; then the black
