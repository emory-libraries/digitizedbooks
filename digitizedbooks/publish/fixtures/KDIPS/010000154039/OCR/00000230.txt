departments, and by establishing in the vicinity of Leavenworth a camp
of rendezvous and instruction.
" Capt. H. C. Seaman was about the same time commissioned with
like authority for that portion of Kansas lying south of the Kansas
river. The work of recruiting went forward with rapidity, the intelligent
portion of the colored people entering into the work heartily, and evinc¬
ing by their actions a willing readiness to link their future and share the
perils with their white brethren in the war of the rebellion, which then
waged with such violence as to seriously threaten the nationality and
life of the Republic.
"Within sixty days five hundred men were recruited and placed in
camp, and a request made that a battallion be mustered into the United
States service. This request was not complied with, and the reasons
assigned were wholly unsatisfactory, yet accompanied with assurances
of such a nature as to warrant the belief that but a short time would
elapse ere the request would be complied with.
"In the meantime complications with the civil authorities in the
Northern District had arisen, which at one time threatened serious re¬
sults. These complications originated from the following causes, each
affecting different classes:
"1st.—An active sympathy with the rebellion.

the experiment would result in defeat, disaster and disgrace.
"Col. Williams, acting under the orders of his military superiors felt
that it was no part of his duty to take council of any or all of these
classes. He saw no course for him to pursue but to follow his instructions
to the letter. Consequently, when the civil authorities placed themselves
in direct opposition to those of the military, by arresting and confining
the men of the command on the most frivolous charges, and indicting
their commanders for crime, such as unlawfully restraining persons of
their liberty, &c., by enforcing proper military discipline, he ignored the
right of the civil authorities to interfere with his military actions in a
military capacity and under proper authority.
" On the 28th of October, 1862, a command consisting of detach¬
ments from Captain Seaman's and Captain William's recruits, were
moved and camped near Butler. This com'mand—about two hundred
and twenty-five men, under Captain Seaman,—was attacked by a con-
