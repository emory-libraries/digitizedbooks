History of the Black Phalanx.
"' After this attempt to escape, the rebel authorities made an effort
to rob us of everything, particularly pocket-knives, watches, or any"
thing that could aid us to escape. In this they were foiled. They made
us all go to one end of the room and placing a guard through the mid¬
dle, searched us one by one and passed us to the other side. If one had
a knife, watch or money, he had only to toss it over to some one already
searched, and when his turn came would have nothing to show.
"' The guards would not allow us to stand by the windows, and on
one occasion, without warning, fired through a second-story window and
badly wounded an officer on the third floor.
My shoes were nearly worn out when I was captured, and soon be¬
came so worn that I could only keep sole and body together by cutting
strings from the edge of the uppers and lacing them together. These
strings would wear but a little while, and frequent cuttings had made
the shoes very low.
"'Toward the last of January, Capt. Cook received intelligence that
a special exchange had been effected in his case and he was to start at
once for the North. Here was an opportunity to communicate with our
comrades and friends, for up to this time we did not know whether any
of our letters had been received. Capt. Cook had a pair of good stout
brogans. These shoes he urged me to take in exchange for my dilapi¬
dated ones. At first, I felt reluctant to do so, but finally made the ex¬
change and he left us with a light heart, but his anticipations were not
realized, for instead of going directly North he was detained in Libby
Prison until just before the rest of us arrived, and when we reached An¬
napolis he was still there awaiting his leave, and had been obliged to
wear my old shoes until two days previous.
"' Rumors of a general exchange began to circulate, and a few boxes
of provisions and clothing, sent by Northern friends, were delivered.
Among the rest, was a well-filled box from the officers of our regiment,
and twelve hundred dollars Confederate money (being the equivalent of
sixty dollars greenbacks) which they had kindly contributed. Could we
have received the box and money in November, instead of just before our
release, we could have subsisted quite comfortably all winter. As it was,
we lived sumptuously as long as the contents of the box lasted, and
when about a week later we started for Richmond to be paroled, we had
drawn considerably upon the twelve hundred dollars.
"'February 17th, we left Danville for Richmond and were again
quartered in Libby. On the 19th, we signed the parole papers.
"' The second morning after signing the rolls, one of the clerks came
in and said that for want of transportation, only a hundred would be
sent down the river that day, and the rest would follow soon; that those
whose names were called would fall in on the lower floor, ready to start.
As he proceeded to call the roll there was a death-like stillness, and each
listened anxiously to hear his own name. Of our mess only one name
was called. As he stopped reading and folded his rolls and turned to
leave, I thought, what if our army should commence active operations
