History of the Black Phalanx.

behalf of the equal civil rights of the negro race. In it he referred to the gallant
charge of the Phalanx. He said: " It became my painful duty to follow in the track
of that charging column, and there, in a space not wider than the clerk's desk and
three hundred yards long, lay the dead bodies of five hundred and forty-three of my
colored comrades, fallen in defense of their country, who had offered up their lives to
uphold its flag and its honor, as a willing sacrifice: and as I rode along among them,
guiding my horse this way and that way, lest he should profane with his hoofa what
seemed to me the sacred dead, and as I looked on their bronzed faces upturned in th#
shining sun, as if in mute appeal against the wrongs of the country for which they had
given their lives, whose flag had only been to them a flag of stripes, on which no star
of glory had ever shone for them—feeling I had wronged them in the past and believ¬
ing what was the future of my country to them—among my dead comrades there, I
swore to myself a solemn oath—' May my right hand forget its cunning and my
tongue cleave to the roof my mouth, if I ever fail to defend the rights of those men
who have given their blood for me and my country that day and for their race forever,
and God helping me, I will keep that oath."
"NEW MARKET HEIGHTS. *
"' Freedom their battle cry, freedom or leave to die.*1—Boker.
At New Market Heights, there Afric's lineage stood,
And poured out copiously its best blood;
Of them I would sing, my lyre's restrung,
And allures not ditiidently to the song,
Paternal muse with thy patriot valor reign
Supreme, and the brightness of ages regain,
In the deep recess of the past
Lower me, to where the battle's blast
Has been given to oblivion, the sigh
Of dying patriots let greet me nigh.
And my thoughts waft on memory's wing.
To where their charging shouts yet ring.
If mine the task indulgent muse vouchsafed,
Whilst I commune 'mongst bones that paved,
And flesh that bridged the chasm o'er,
Where Butler numbered five hundred and more
of Afric's sons, who for liberty fell.
In the corridors of a stockaded hell.
I'll essay their deeds of valor done,
By which the nation its victory won.
'Twas early in the grey September morn,
Ere the suns fulgent light had shown.
Whilst departed patriots looked out from above.
Emitting their twinkling silvery light of love.
Upon the silent bivouac of freedom's sons,
Weary and resting upon their bayonetless guns;
Quite near the bank of the James,
Just above where their own fathers' names,
Were first enrolled as ignoble slaves.
The Second Brigade, valiant men and braves.
Saw a meteor like rocket burst high,
High up in the dewey morning sky,
Then came the summons prepare to away,
Butler leads to New Market heights at day.
Beat the long roll, sound the alarm,
Break the monotone and the dead calm,
And the bugle's clarion notes aroused, awoke,
The host that waited ere day broke;
Infantry, cavalry prepared to make away,
Butler leads to New Market heights at day.
From rank to rank the summons ran,
Bayonets rattle and clank of sabres began.
With whetted steel the sturdy axe-men,
Capless rifle-men, horseless cavalry men,
Formed on that plain in battle array,
Butler leads to New Market heights at day.
When the flash of dawn was breaking,
Their leader rode in front, and speaking.
Gave the charging shout 'Remember Fort Pillow"
And their banners brightened in the mellow
Light of heaven; ' Forward,' they marched away.
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
