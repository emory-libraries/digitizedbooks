The War of 1775.

then the whites would not, and could not be induced to
rally to the defence of their own particular section and
homes.
For fear that I may be accused of too highly coloring
the picture of the Southern laxity of fervor and patriot¬
ism, I quote from the valuable essay which accompanies
the history of the American Loyalists:
" The whole number of regulars enlisted for the Continental service,
from the beginning to the close of the struggle, was 231,959. Of these,
I have once remarked, 67.907 were from Massachusetts; and I may
now add, that every State south of Pennsylvania provided but 59,493,
or 8,414 less than this single State."

relief. Had we arms for three thousand such black men as I could select
in Carolina, I should have no doubt of success in driving the British out
of Georgia, and subduing East Florida before the end of July."
Washington knew the temper of the Southerners. He
was well aware that slaves could not be entrusted with
arms within sight of the enemy's camp, and within hear¬
