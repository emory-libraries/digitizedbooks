ants and added their thunders to the universal din; the harbor of
Charleston was a volcano. The want of water was felt, but now again
"unconsciously the enemy came to the assistance of the garrison, for water
was actually scooped from the craters made in the sand by the exploded
shells. The city of Charleston was alive and aflame with excitement; the
bay, the wharves, the steeples and streets filled with anxious spectators
looking across the water at their defenders, whom they could not succor.
"At 2 o'clock the flag halliards were cut by a shot and the Confeder¬
ate garrison flag was blown over into the fort; there was an instant race
for its recovery through the storm of missiles, over the broken earth and
shells and splinters which lined the parade. Major Ramsey, Sergeant
Shelton and private Flinn, of the Charleston Battalion, and Lieutenant
Riddick, of the Sixty-third Georgia, first reached it and bore it back in
triumph to the flagstaff, and at the same moment Captain Barnwell, of
the engineers, seized a battle-flag, and leaping on the ramparts, drove
the staff into the sand. This flag was again shot away, but was again
replaced by Private Gaillard, of the Charleston Battalion. These intre¬
pid actions, emulating in a higher degree the conduct of Sergeant Jasper
at Moultrie during the Revolution, were cheered by the command and in¬
spired them with renewed courage.
" The day wore on; thousands upon thousands of shells and round
shot, shells loaded with balls, shells of guns and shells of mortars, per¬
cussion shells, exploding upon impact, shells with graded fuses—every
kind apparently known to the arsenals of war leaped into and around
the doomed fort, yet there was no cessation; the sun seemed to stand
still and the long midsummer day to know no night. Some men were
dead and no scratch appeared on their bodies; the concussion had forced
the breath from their lungs and collapsed them into corpses. Captain
Twiggs, of the staff, in executing some orders was found apparently
dead. He was untoucted, but lifeless, and only strong restoratives
brought him back to animation, and the commanding officer was buried
knee-deep in sand and had to be rescued by ■ spades from his imprison¬
ment. The day wore on, hours followed hours of anxiety and grim en¬
durance, but no respite ensued. At last night came; not however, to
herald a cessation of the strife, but to usher in a conflict still more terri¬
ble. More than eleven hours had passed. The fort wras torn and muti¬
lated ; to the outside observer it was apparently powerless, knocked to
pieces and pounded out of shape, the outline changed, the exterior slope
full of gaping wounds, the ditch half filled up, but the interior still pre¬
served its form and its integrity; scarred and defaced it was yet a citadel
which, although not offensive, was defiant.
It was nearly eight o'clock at night, but still twilight, when a calm
came and the blazing circle ceased to glow with flame. The ominous
pause was understood; it required no signals to be read by those to
whom they were not directed to inform them that the supreme moment
to test the value of the day's achievements was now at hand. It meant
nothing but assault. Dr. Dennison says the assault was intended to be
