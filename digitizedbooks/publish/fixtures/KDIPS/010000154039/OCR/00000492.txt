History of the Black Phalanx.
the best foundation upon which, the fidelity of an army can rest, espe¬
cially in a service which imposes peculiar hardships and privations, is
the personal interest of the soldier in the issue of the contest. Such an
interest we can give our negroes by granting immediate freedom to all
who enlist, and freedom at the end of the war to the families of those
who discharge their duties faithfully, whether they survive or not,
together with the privilege of residing at the south.
" To this might be added a bounty for faithful service, "We should
not expect slaves to fight for prospective freedom when they can secure
it at once by going to the enemy, in whose service they will incur no
greater risk than in ours. The reasons that induce me to recommend
the employment of negro troops at all render the effect of the measures
I have suggested upon slavery immaterial, and in my opinion the best
means of securing the efficiency and fidelity of this auxiliary force would
be to accompany the measure with a well-digested plan of gradual and
general emancipation. As that will be the result of the continuance of
the war, and will certainly occur if the enemy succeed, it seems to me
most advisable to adopt it at once, and thereby obtain all the benefits
that will accrue to our cause.
"The employment of negro troops under regulations similar to
those indicated would, in my opinion, greatly increase our military
strength, and enable us to relieve our white population to some extent.
I think we could dispense with the reserve forces, except in eases of
emergency. It would disappoint the hopes which our enemies have upon
our exhaustion, deprive them in a great measure of the aid they now
derive from black troops, and thus throw the burden of the war upon
their own people. In addition to the great political advantages that
would result fb our cause from the adoption of a system of emancipa¬
tion, it would exercise a salutary influence upon our negro population,
by rendering more secure the fidelity of those who become soldiers, and
diminishing the inducements to the rest to abscond.
"I can only say in conclusion that whatever measures are to be
adopted should be adopted at once. Every day's delay increases the
difficulty. Much time will be required to organize and discipline the
men, and action may be deferred till it is too late.
"Very respectfully,
"Your obedient servant,
"A true copy. J. B. W." "(Signed,) E. E. LEE, General.
This letter was intended for members of Congress to
read, and it was circulated among them, but all was not
harmony. Many members were bitterly opposed to arm¬
ing the slaves, some of them denounced General Lee for
writing the letter, and prepared to oppose the measure
when it should be introduced into Congress.*
» * Gpnpral William C. Wickham led the opponents of the project in a very bitter
pro-slavery speech.
