Port Royal, instead of Fredericksburg, his depot for sup¬
plies. Sending his reserve artillery to Belle Plain, he pre¬
pared to advance. It was in this manoeuvre that Lee, for
the last time, attacked the Federal forces, outside of
cover, in any important movement. The attempt to
change the base of supply was indeed a hazardous move
for Grant; it necessitated the moving of his immense
train, numbering four thousand wagons, used in carrying
rations, ammunition and supplies for his army, and
transportation of the badly wounded to the rear, where
they could be cared for.
Up to this time the Wilderness campaign had been a
continuous fight and march. The anxiety which Grant
felt for his train, is perhaps best told by himself:
" My movements are terribly embarrassed by our immense wagon
train. It could not be avoided, however."
It was the only means by which the army could ob¬
tain needful supplies, and was consequently indispensable.
It was the near approach to the train that made the con¬
federates often fight so desperately, for they knew if they
could succeed in capturing a wagon they would probably
get something to eat. Soon after the advance began, it
was reported to Grant, that the confederate cavalry was
in. the rear, in search of the trains. On the 14th he or¬
dered General Ferrero to "keep a sharp lookout for this
cavalry, and if you can attack it with your (Phalanx) in-
•fantry and (white) cavalry, do so." On the 19th Ferrero,
with his Phalanx division, (4th division, 9th Corps) was
on the road to Fredericksburg, in rear of and to the
right of General Tyler's forces, in the confederates' front.
The road formed Grant's direct communication with his
base, and here the confederates, under Ewell attacked the
Federal troops. Grant sent this dispatch to Ferrero:
" The enemy have crossed the Ny on the right of our lines, in consid¬
erable force, and may possibly detach a force to move on Fredericks¬
burg. Keep your cavalry pickets well out on the plank road, and all
other roads leading west and south of you. If you find the enemy mov¬
ing infantry and artillery to you, report it promptly. In that case take
up strong positions and detain him all you can, turning all your trains
