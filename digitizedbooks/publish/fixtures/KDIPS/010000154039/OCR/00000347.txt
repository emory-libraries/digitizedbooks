The Black Flag.

one to two dollars, which, with the twenty, saved me from starvation.
I bought rice of the guard for two dollars the half-pint, and good-sized
potatoes for a dollar each. These were cooked usually over a little fire
in the yard with wood or chips picked up whil$ going for water. Some¬
times, by waiting patiently for an hour or more, I could get near enough
to the stove to put my cup on. The heating apparatus was a poor apol¬
ogy for a cylinder coal-stove, and the coal the poorest I ever saw, and
gave so little heat that one could stand all day by it and shiver.
"' The bed-quilt was qiffie narrow, but very much better than none.
"'Capt. Weiss and I would spread our flannel coats on the floor, use
our shoes for pillows, spread the quilt over us, and with barely space to
turn over, would, if the night was not too cold, go to sleep; usually to
dream of home and loved ones; of Christmas festivities and banquets;
of trains of army wagons so overloaded with pies and cakes that they
were rolling into the road; of a general exchange; a thirty day's leave
of absence, and a thousand things altogether unlike that which we were
experiencing; and would wake oniy to find ourselves cold and hungry.
"' Our mess had the volume of Harper's Magazine, found at Salis¬
bury, and we each could have it an hour or more daily. A few games of
checkers or cribbage, played sitting on the floor, tailor-fashion, were
always in order. All who were accustomed to smoking would manage to
secure a supply of tobacco at least sufficient for one smoke per day, and,
if they could not obtain it in any other way, would sell half their scanty
ration, and perhaps get enough to last a week. It was a good place to
learn how to economize. I have known some to refuse a light from the
pipe, for fear of losing a grain of the precious weed. Evenings we would
be in darkness, and as we could not move about without frequent colli¬
sions, would gather in little groups and talk of home, friends, and the
good time coming, when we would have one good, square meal; arrange
the bill of fare, comprising all the delicacies that heart could wish, or a
morbid mind prompted by a starving stomach could conceive; lay platis
for escape and discuss the route to be followed; sing a few hymns and the
national airs, and wind up with ' We'll Hang Jeff Davis on a Sour Apple
Tree.'
"' There were with us two officers who, when we arrived at Salisbury,
had been in solitary confinement and whom the rebels were holding as
hostages for two guerillas whom Gen. Burnside had condemned to be
shot. When the removal of the officers to Danville occurred, these two
were released from close confinement and sent on with us, and it was
thought they were no longer considered as hostages. They had planned
an escape and well nigh succeeded. They had dug a hole through the
brick wall, and passing into an adjoining unoccupied building, cut
through the floor, dug under the stone foundation and were just coming
through on the outside, when some one in passing stepped on the thin
crust and fell in. Whether he or the men digging were the most fright¬
ened it would be hard to tell. The next morning these two who had
Worked so hard to regain their liberty were taken out and probably
placed in close confinement again.
