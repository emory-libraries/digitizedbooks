520 History of the Black Phalanx.
Towards night, however, it was discovered that the enemy was massing
in our immediate front, and juet before sunset they commenced the
attack. The contest was sharp and short; a fierce roar of musketry,
mingled with wild yells and the deep bass of cannon; a fainter yell and
volleys less steady; finally a few scattering shots and the attack was
repulsed. As this movement of the two corps on the right was merely a
feint to cover more active operations on the left, it was resolved to with¬
draw the forces during the night. The movement began just after dark.
We marched to the Bermuda Hundreds front, and pitched our camp near
Point of Rocks. On the 24th of August, 1864, the 10th Corps relieved
the 18th Corps in front of Petersburg. Here we remained, doing duty in
the trenches, until the 24th of September, at which time the 10th Corps
marcAed to the rear to rest a few days preparatory to an advance upon
Richmond then in contemplation. While here our ragged, dirty, and
shoeless men were clad, washed, and shod as rapidly as possible.
"At length, at about sundown, September 28th, the corps broke
camp, and we once more started for Deep Bottom, which place we
reached about four A. M., September 29th.
"Just as the first faint glimmerings of light were visible the move¬
ment against Richmond commenced. After pushing through a deep
wood our brigade formed in line of battle near the New Market Road,
under fire of a rebel battery. We had scarcely formed when it was foun,d
that the rebel lines had been broken further to the left, and we were
ordered forward in pursuit of the flying foe. Three successive lines had
been carried by impetuous charges, and during that summer forenoon
the enemy on all sides was pressed steadily back. By noon Fort Ham-
son, a large powerful work, and a key to a large portion of the rebel line,
had been carried at the bayonet point by the 18th Corps, and we found
ourselves in front of the strongest line of the outer defenses of Richmond.
An assault was immediately ordered. Two regiments of the brigade to
which this regiment was attached,—the 7th Maryland and 8th Pennsyl¬
vania—were selected to make the attack on Fort Gilmer, the 29th Con¬
necticut and 9th Maryland being held in reserve. A charge was made
on the double-quick through a felled forest, half a mile in extent. They
were met by a murderous enfilading fire, and after an obstinate struggle
were forced back. They re-formed quickly and again charged, this time
up the very guns of the fort. After a most heroic fight they were again
compelled to retire. Some of the companies sprang into the ditch, and
refused to surrender even after their companions had been driven back.
They continued the unequal contest until dark, when we were forced to
leave the brave men to their fate.
"After the repulse of the second charge, the brigade formed under a
galling fire, preparatory to another charge, but after a careful survey
of the enemy's position, it was deemed advisable to delay the attack
for the present. Darkness soon after coming on, the troops were quietly
withdrawn to one of the captured lines a short distance in our rear.
Next morning vigorous measures were at once taken to reverse this line,
