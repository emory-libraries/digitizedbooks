Ws plantation, some twelve miles above New Orleans, on the opposite side of the river,
lie has a son in the secession army, whose uniform and equipments, &c., are the sym¬
bols of secession of which General Phelps speaks. Mr. La Blanche's house was searched
by the order of General Phelps, for arms and contraband of war, and his neighbors say
that his negroes were told that they were free if they would come to the general's
camp.
" That thereupon the negroes, under the lead of Jack, determined to leave, and for
that purpose crowded into a small boat which, from overloading, was in danger of
swamping.
" La Blanche then told his negroes that if they were determined to go, they would
be drowned, and he would hire them a large boat to put them across the river, and
that they might have their furniture if they would go and leave his plantation and crop
to ruin.
" They decided to go, and La Blanche did all a man could to make that going safe.
"The account of General Phelps is the negro side of the story; that above given is
the story of Mr. La Blanche's neighbors, some of whom I know to be loyal men.
" An order against negroes being allowed in camp is the reason they are outside.
" Mr. La Blanche is represented to be a humane man, and did not consent to the
'exodus* of his negroes.
" General Phelps, I believe, intends making this a test case for the policy of the gov¬
ernment. I wish it might be so, for the difference of our action upon this subject is a
source of trouble] I respect his honest sincerity of opinion, but I am a soldier, bound
to carry out the wishes of my government so long as I hold its commission, and I un¬
derstand that policy to be the one I am pursuing. I do not feel at liberty to pursue
any other. If the policy of the government is nearly that I sketched in my report
upon the subject and that which I have ordered in this department, then the services of
General Phelps are worse than useless here. If the views set forth in his report are to
obtain, then he is invaluable, for his whole soul is in it, and he is a good soldier of
large experience, and no braver man lives. I beg to leave the whole question with the
president, with perhaps the needless assurance that his wishes shall be loyally followed,
•were they not in accordance with my own, as I have now no right to have any upon
the subject.
" I write in haste, as the steamer ■' Mississippi' is awaiting this dispatch.
"Awaiting the earliest possible instructions, I have the honor to be,
"Your most obedient servant,
"B. F. Butler, Major General Commanding."
Gen. Phelps waited about six weeks for a reply, but
none came. Meanwhile the negroes continued to gather
at his camp. He said, in regard to not receiving an
answer, "I was left to the inference that silence gives con¬
sent, and proceeded therefore to take such decided meas¬
ures as appeared best calculated, to me, to dispose of the
difficulty." Accordingly he made the following requisition
upon head-quarters :
"Camp Parapet, La., July 30, 1862.
"Captain R. S. Davis, A. A. A. General, New Orleans, La.:
"Sib :—I enclose herewith requisitions for arms, accoutrements, clothing, camp and
garrison equipage, &c., for three regiments of Africans, which I propose to raise
tor the defense of this point. The location is swampy and unhealthy, and our men
are dying at the rate of two or three a day.
" The southern loyalists are willing, as I understand, to furnish their share of the
tax for the support of the war; but they should also furnish their quota of men, which
they have not thus far done. An opportunity now offers of supplying the deficiency;
and it is not safe to neglect opportunities in war. I think that, with the proper facili¬
ties, 1 could raise the three regiments proposed in a short time. Without holding out
any inducements, or offering any reward, I have now upward of three hundred Africans
organized into Ave companies, who are all willing and ready to show their devotion to
our cause in any way that it may be put to the test. They are willing to submit to
anything rather than to slavery.
"Society in the South seems to be on the point of dissolution; and the best way of
preventing the African from becoming instrumental in a general state of anarchy, is to
enlist him In the cause of the Republic. If we nyect his services, any petty military
chieftain, by offering him freedom, can have them for the purpose of robbery and plun¬
der. It is for the interests of the South, as well of the North, that the African should
be permitted to offer his block for the temple of freedom. Sentiments unworthy of the
man of the present day—worthy only of another Cain—could alone prevent Buch an
offer from being accepted.
" I would recommend that the cadet graduates of the present year should be sent
