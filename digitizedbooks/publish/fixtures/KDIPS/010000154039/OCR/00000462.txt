460 History of the Black Phalanx.
He was out-marched, out-fought^ out-witted, out-generaled—defeated iD
every possible way. He and his army, every man, numbering 27,516,
surrendered. He and his army, every man, was fed by the conqueror."
From the date of Lee's surrender, the confederates,
from Virginia to the Mississippi, began to lay down their
arms. Howell Cobb surrendered at Macon, Ga., on the
21st; Johnston surrendered to General Sherman on the
26th, in North Carolina; Dick Taylor, east of the Missis¬
sippi, on the 4th of May, and on the 26th Kirby Smith
surrendered his forces west of the Mississippi. Jeff. Davis
had been captured, disguised as a woman, and thus the

their part all through the long night of war, and at last
they occupied Charleston,—the traitors' nest,—Peters¬
burg,—their eastern Gibraltar,— and Richmond—their
Capitol. They marched proudly through the streets of
these once impregnable fortresses, in all of which many of
the soldiers of the Phalanx had been slaves. Oh! what a
realization of the power of right over might. What a
picture for the historian's immortal pen to paint of the
freemen of America, whose sufferings were long, wThose
struggle was gigantic, and whose achievement was a glo-
rious personal and political freedom!
At the close of the war, the government, anticipating
trouble in Texas, ordered General Steele to the command
of the Rio Grande, under these instructions:
