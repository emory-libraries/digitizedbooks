should be averted. "With this in view he wrote to Joseph
Reed in December, saying:
"If the Virginians are wise, that arch-traitor to the rights of
humanity, Lord Dunmorc, should be instantly crushed, if it takes the
whole army to do it; otherwise, like a snowball in rolling, his army will
get size, some through fear, some through promises, and some through
inclination, joining his standard; but that which renders the measure
indispensable is the negroes; for, if he gets formidable, numbers of them
will be tempted to join, who will be afraid to do it without."
Notwithstanding this, the Southern States still kept
the negro out of the army. It was not until affairs be¬
came alarmingly dangerous, and a few weeks before the
adoption of the Declaration of Independence, that the
subject of arming the slaves came again before the peoplef
In May, 1777, the General Assembly of Connecticut
postponed in one house and rejected in the other the
report of a committee "that the effective negro and mu¬
latto slaves be allowed to enlist with the Continental bat-
tallions now raising in this State." But under a law
passed at the same session "white and black, bond and
free, if' able bodied,' went on the roll together, accepted as
the representatives of their'class,'or as substitutes for
their employers." At the next session (October, 1777),
the law was so amended as to authorize the selectmen of
any town, on the application of the master.—after 'in¬
quiry into the age, abilities, circumstances, and character'
of the servant or slave, and being satislied 'that it was
likely to be consistent with his real advantage, and that
he would be able to support himself,'—to grant liberty for
his emancipation, and to discharge the master 'from any
charge or cost which may be occasioned by maintaining
or supporting the servant or slave made free as afore¬
said.' Mr. J. H. Trumbull, of Connecticut, in giving the
foregoing facts, adds :
"The slave (or servant for term of years) might receive his freedom;
the master might receive exemption from draft, and a discharge from
future liabilities, to which he must otherwise have been subjected. In
point of fact, some hundreds of blacks,—slaves and freemen,—were en¬
listed, from time to time, in the regiments of State troops and of the
Connecticut line."
