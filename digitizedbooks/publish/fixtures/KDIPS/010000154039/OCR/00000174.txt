172 History of the Black Phalanx.
Nor can too much trouble be taken properly to prepare persons to fill
the responsible position of officers. Each State should have its military
academy. In the meantime much good can be done by instituting a
school for the instruction of persons (especially those who have had
some experience in the service) who may have the requisite capacity and
zeal to serye their country with advantage. Eschew all humbuggery
and mere pretension, and let merit be the test of advancement.
' Let it be impressed deeply on the conscience of every man of influ¬
ence and authority that when he places in command an incompetent
officer he is guilty of manslaughter. The country has lost millions of
treasure and thousands of lives by the incompetency of officers. We
have many enemies on earth besides the Southern rebels. The fate of
free institutions, not only in our own eountry, but in other lands, the

the North, generally. They were officered by the elitey
such as Col. R. G. Shaw, of the 54th Massachusetts, a for¬
mer member of the 7th New York Regiment, and upon
whose battle monument his name is carved. Cols. James
C. Beecher, fm. Birney and a host of others, whose names
can now be found on the army rolls, with the prefix Gen¬
eral, commanded these regiments, Of those who com¬
manded Southern regiments this is equally true, especially
of those who served in the 9th, 10th, 18th and 19th
Corps. .Col. Godfred Weitzel, who in March, 1865, had been
promoted to Major General of Volunteers, commanded
