History of the Black Phalanx.
battle. The conduct of the negro soldiers in Gen. Jack¬
son's army on that occasion has ever been applauded by
the American people. Mr. Day, in Nell's "Colored Patriots
of the American Revolution," says:
"From an authenticated chart, belonging to a soldier friend, I find
that, in the battle of New Orleans, Major-General Andrew Jackson,
Commander-in-Chief, and his staff, were just at the right of the advanc¬
ing left column of the British, and that very near him were stationed the
colored soldiers. He is numbered 6, and the position of the colored soldiers
8. The chart explanation of No. 8 reads thus:— '8. Captains Domi¬
nique and Bluche, two 24 pounders; Major Lacoste's battalion, formed
of the men of color of New Orleans and, Major Daquin's battalion,
formed of the men of color of St. Domingo, under Major Savary, second
in command.'
" They occupied no mean place, and did no mean service.
" From other documents in my possession, I am able to state the
number of the 'battalion of St. Domingo men of color' to have been
one hundred and fifty; and of 'Major Lacoste's battalion of Louisiana
men of color,' two hundred and eighty.
"Thus were over four hundred 'men of color' in that battle. "When
it is remembered that the whole number of soldiers claimed by Ameri¬
cans to have been in that battle reached only 3600, it will be seen that
the ' men of color' were present in much larger proportion than their
numbers in the country warranted.
"Neither was there colorphobia then. Major Planche's battalion of
uniformed volunteer companies, and Major Lacoste's 'men of color,'
fought together; so, also, did Major Daquin's 'men of color,' and the
44th, under Captain Baker."
Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, in his speech in Congress
on the Imprisonment of Colored Seamen, September,
1850, bore this testimony to their gallant conduct:
"I have an impression, that, not, indeed, in these piping times of
peace, but in the time of war, when quite a boy, I have seen black sol¬
diers enlisted, who did faithful and excellent service. But, however it
may have been in the Northern States, I can tell the Senator what hap¬
pened in the Southern States at this period. I believe that I shall be
borne out in saying, that no regiments did better service, at New Orleans,
than did the black regiments, which were organized under the direction
of General Jackson himself, after a most glorious appeal to the patriot¬
ism and honor of the people of color of that region; and which, after
they came out of the war, received the thanks of General Jackson, in a
proclamation which has been thought worthy of being inscribed on the
pages of history."
