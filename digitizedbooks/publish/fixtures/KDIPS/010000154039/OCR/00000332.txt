History of the Black Phalanx.
the parley which ensued, and while the firing ceased on both sides, the
rebels kept crowding up to the works on the side near Cold Creek, and
also approached nearer on the south side, thereby gaining advantages
pending the conference under tho flag of truce. As soon as the flag of
truce was withdrawn the attack began, and about five minutes after it
began the rebels entered the fort. Our troops were soon overpowered,
and broke and fled. A large number of the soldiers, black and white, and
also a few citizens, myself among the number, rushed down the bluff
toward the river. I concealed myself as well as I could in a position
where I could distinctly see all that passed below the bluff, for a consider¬
able distance up and down the river.
'"A large number, at least one hundred, were hemmed in near the
river bank by bodies of the rebels coming from both north and south.
Most all of those thus hemmed in were without arms. I saw many sol¬
diers, both white and black, throw up their arms in token of surrender,
and cq,li out that they had surrendered. The rebels would reply, 'G—d
d—n you, why didn't you surrender before?' and shot them down like
dogs.
"' The rebels commenced an indiscriminate slaughter. Many colored
soldiers sprang into the river and tried to escape by swimming, but these
were invariably shot dead.
"£A short distance from me, and within view, a number of our
wounded had been placed, and near where Major Booth's body lay; and
a small red flag indicated that at that place fur wounded were placed.
The rebels however, as they passed these wounded men, fired right into
them and struck them with the butts of their muskets. The cries for
mercy and groans which arose from the poor fellows were heartrending.
"' Thinking that if I should be discovered, I would be killed, I emerged
from my hiding place, and, approaching the nearest rebel, I told him I
was a citizen. He said, 'You are in bad company, G—d d—n you; out
with your greenbacks, or I'll shoot you.' I gave him all the money I
had, and under his convoy I went up into the fort again.
"' When I re-entered the fort there was still some shooting going on.
I heard a rebel officer tell a soldier not to kill any more of those negroes.
He said that they would all be killed, any way, when they were tried.
"'After I entered the fort, and after the United States flag had been
taken down, the rebels held it up in their hands in the presence of their
officers, and thus gave the rebels outside a chance to still continue their
slaughter, and I did not notice that any rebel officer forbade the holding
of it up. I also further state, to the best of my knowledge and informa¬
tion, that there were not less than three hundred and sixty negroes
killed and two hundred whites. This I give to the best of my knowledge
and belief. JOHN NELSON.
