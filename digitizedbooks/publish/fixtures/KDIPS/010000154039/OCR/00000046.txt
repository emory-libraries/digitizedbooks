History of the Black Phalanx.
fought, when our forts on Lake Champlain had been taken, from us, and
when Montgomery and Arnold were pressing on our possessions in Can¬
ada, Lord Dunmore carried his threat into execution. Having estab¬
lished his headquarters at Norfolk, he proclaimed freedom to all the
slaves who would repair to his standard and beai* arms for the King.
The summons was readily obeyed by the most of the negroes who had
the means of escape to him. He, at the same time, issued a proclama¬
tion, declaring martial law throughout the colony of Virginia; and he
collected a number of armed vessels, which cut off the coasting trade,
made many prizes, and greatly distressed an important part of that
Province. If he could have opened a road to slaves in the interior of the
Province, his measures would have been very fatal to the planters. In
order to stop the alarming desertion of the negroes, and to arrest his
Lordship in his career, the provincial Assembly detached against him a
strong force of more than a thousand men, who arrived in the neighbor¬
hood of Norfolk in the month of December. Having made a circuit, they
came to a village called Great Bridge, where the river Elizabeth was
traversed by a bridge; but before their arrival the bridge had been made
impassable, and some works, defended chiefly by negroes, had been
thrown up."
During the same month Edmund Pendleton wrote to
Kichard Henry Lee that many slaves had flocked to the
British standard:
"The Governor, * * * * marched out with three hundred and
fifty soldiers, Tories and slaves, to Kemp's Landing; and after setting
up his standard, and issuing his proclamation, declaring all persons reb¬
els who took up arms for the country, and inviting all slaves, servants
and apprentices to come to him and receive arms, he proceded to inter¬
cept Hutchings and his party, upon whom he came by surprise, but
received, it seems, so warm a fire, that the ragmuffins ran away. They
were, however, rallied on discovering that that two companies of our
militia gave away; and left Hutchings and Dr. Eeid with a volunteer
company, who maintained their ground bravely till they were overcome
by numbers, and took shelter in a swamp. The slaves were sent in pur¬
suit of them; and one of Col. Hutching's, with another, found him. On
their approach, he discharged his pistol at his slave, but missed him;
and he was taken by them, after receiving a wound in the face with a
sword. The number taken or killed on either side is not ascertained. It
is said the Governor went to Dr. Eeid's shop, and after taking the medi¬
cines and dressing necessary for his wounded men, broke all the others to
pieces. Letters mention that slaves flock to him in abundance; but I
lope it is magnified."
Five months after he issued the proclamation, Lord
Dunmore thus writes, concerning his success:
