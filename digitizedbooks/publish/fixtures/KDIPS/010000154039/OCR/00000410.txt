History of the Black Phalanx.
works. A strong feeling of pride and esprit de corps sprung up within
the hearts of the blacks, and they began to think that they too might
soon have the opportunity of some glory for their race and country.'
How natural was this feeling. As we have seen, their
life for more than a month had been one of marching and
counter-marching, though hazardous and patriotic. When
on the 18th, they entered upon the more active duty of
soldiers, they found the 3rd Division of the 18th Corps,
composed of the Phalanx of the Army of the James,
covered with glory, and the welkin ringing with praises of
their recent achievements. The men of the 4th Division
chafed with eager ambition to rival their brothers of the
18th Corps, in driving the enemy from the Cockade City.
General Burnside was equally as anxious to give his black
boys a chance to try the steel of the chivalry in deadly
conflict, and this gave them consolation, with the assur¬
ance that their day would ere long dawn, so they toiled
and drilled carefully for their prospective glory.
But the situation of the Phalanx before Petersburg
was far from being enviable. Smarting under the thrash¬
ing they had received from Hinks' division, the confeder¬
ates were ever ready now to slaughter the "niggers"
when advantage offered them the opportunity. A steady,
incessant fire was kept up against the positions the Pha*-
lanx occupied, and their movements were watched with
great vigilance. Although they did not raise the black
flag, yet manifestly no quarter to negro troops, or to
white troops that fought with them, was the confeder¬
ates' determination.
" Judging from their actions, the presence of the negro soldiers,
both in the Eighteenth and Ninth Corps," says Woodbury, "seemed to
have the effect of rendering the enemy more spiteful than ever before the
Fourth Division came. The closeness of the lines on the front of the
corps rendered constant watchfulness imperative, and no day passed
without some skirmishing between the opposing pickets. "When the
colored soldiers appeared, this practice seemed to increase, while in
front of the Fifth Corps, upon the left of our line, there was little or
no picket firing, and the outposts of both armies were even disposed to
be friendly. On the front of the Ninth, the firing was incessant, and
in many cases fatal."
