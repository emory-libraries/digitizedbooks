History of the Black Phalanx.
the party? And what I refer to is negroes. "We have divers of them in
our service, mixed with white men. But I think it would be more proper
to raise a body by themselves, than to have them intermixed with the
white men; and their ambition would entirely be to outdo the white men
in every measure that the fortunes of war calls a soldier to endure. And
I could rely with dependence upon them in the field of battle or to any
post that I was sent to defend with them; and they would think them¬
selves happy could they gain their freedom by bearing a part of subdu¬
ing the enemy that is invading our land, and clear a peaceful inheritance
for their masters, and posterity yet to come, that they are now slaves to."
The letter from which this extract was made was duly
referred to a joint committee "to consider the same and
report." Some days later "a resolution of the General
Assembly of Rhode Island for enlisting negroes in the pub¬
lic service "was referred to the same committee. They
duly reported the draft of a law, differing little from the
Rhode Island Resolution. A separate organization of
negro companies, by Kench, does not appear to have been
deemed advisable at that time. The usage was continued
of "taking," in the words of Kench, "negroes in our
service, intermixed with the white men."
The negroes of Boston and their abolition friends,
rather insisted upon the intermingling of the races in the
army, believing that this course had a greater tendency to
destroy slavery, and the inequality of rights among the
blacks and whites; though it deprived the negroes, as we
now see, of receiving due credit for their valor, save in a
few individual cases. It was not in Massachusetts alone,
but in many other States that the same idea prevailed;
and now the facts connected with the services of the
negroes are to be gathered only in fragments, from the
histories of villages and towns, or among the archives of
the State, in a disconnected and unsatisfactory form.
The legislature of New York, two months after the
murder of Col, Greene and his faithful negro troops at
Point's Bridge, in that State, by the British, passed an
act (March, 1781) looking to the raising of two regiments.
The sixth section of the act reads as follows:
"And it is further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that any per¬
son who shall deliver one or more of his able-bodied male slaves to any
