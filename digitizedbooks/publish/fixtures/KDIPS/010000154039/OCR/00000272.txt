270 History of the Black Phalanx.
entered the field in front, charged the rebels in the centre of the line,
driving them into their rifle-pits, and then for half an hour the carnage
beeatae frightful. They had followed the rebels into the very jaws of
death, and now C61. Reid found his regiment in the enemy's enfilading
fire, and they swept his line. Men fell like snowflakes. Driven by this
terrific fire, they fell back. The 54th had taken ground to the right,
lending whatever of assistance they could to their retiring comrades,
who were about on a line with them, for although retreating, it was in
the most cool and deliberate manner, and the two regiments began a
firing at will against which the rebels, though outnumbering them, could
not face. Thus they held them till long after sunset, and firing ceased.
"The slaughter was terrible; the Phalanx lost about 800 men, the
white troops about 600. It was Braddock's defeat after the lapge of a
century."
The rout was complete; the army was not only de¬
feated but beaten and demoralized. The enemy had suc¬

late it. Seymour had advanced, contrary to the orders
given him by General Gillmore, from Baldwin's Station,
where he was instructed to intrench and await orders.
"Whether or not he sought to retrieve the misfortunes that
had attended him in South Carolina, in assaulting the
enemy's works, is a question which need not be discussed
here. It is only necessary to show the miserable misman¬
agement of the advance into the enemy's country. The
troops were marched into an amtmscade, where they were
slaughtered by the enemy at will. Even after finding his
troops ambuscaded, and within two hundred yards of the
confederate fortifications, General Seymour did not at¬
tempt to fall back and form a line of battle, though he
had sufficient artillery, but rushed brigade after brigade
up to the enemy's guns, only to be mowed down by the
withering storm of shot. Each brigade in turn went in as
spirited as any troops ever entered a fight, but stampeded
out of it maimed, mangled and routed. At sunset the
road, foot-paths and woods leading back to Saunders*
Station, was full of brave soldiers hastening from the
massacre of their comrades, in their endeavor to escape
capture. At about nine o'clock that night, what remained
of the left column, Colonel Montgomery's brigade, consist¬
ing of the 54th and 35th Phalanx Regiments, and a bat-
