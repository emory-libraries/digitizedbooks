the question is put, we shall be out-voted there with as much disparity
as we have been in this country.

"I earnestly desire to be where any active plans are likely to be
executed, and to be near your Excellency on all occasions in which my
services can be acceptable. The pursuit of an object which, I con¬
fess, is a favorite one with me, because I always regarded the interests
of this country and those of the Union as intimately connected with it,
has detached me more than once from your family, but those sentiments
of veneration and attachments with which your Excellency has inspired
me, keep me always near you, with the sincerest and most zealous wishes
for a continuance of your happiness and glory."
Here ended the project of arming negroes in South
Carolina, and before an earnest effort could be made in
Georgia, the brave man laid his life upon the altar of
American liberty.
But to show the state of public opinion at the Ssouth,
as understood by the Commander-in-Chief of the Ameri¬
can army, we have but to read Washington's reply to Col.
Laurens' last letter, in which he speaks of "making a last
effort" id Georgia. Gen. Washington uses this emphatic
language:
"I must confess that I am not at all astonished at the failure of your
plan. That spirit of freedom, which, at the commencement of this con¬
test, would have gladly sacrificed everything to the attainment of its
object, has long since subsided, and every selfish passion has taken its
place. It is not the public but private interest which influences the gen¬
erality of mankind; nor can the Americans any longer boast an excep¬
tion. Under the circumstances, it would rather have been surprising if
you had succeeded; nor will you, I fear, have better success in Georgia."
This letter settles forever any boast of the Southerners,
that to them is due the credit of gaining the independence
of the United States. It is true Cornwallis' surrender at
Yorktown, Va., was the last of the series of battles fought
for independence.* But we must remember that the
* The'Burlington Gazette, in an issue of some time ago, gives the following account
of an aged negro Revolutionary patriot: "The attention of many of our citizens has
doubtless been arrested by the appearance of an old colored man, who might have been
seen, sitting in front of his residence, in east Union street, respectfully raising his hat to
those who might be passing by. His attenuated frame, his silvered head, his feeble
movements, combine to prove that he is very aged: and yet, comparatively few are
aware that he is among the survivors of the gallant army who fought for the liberties
of our country.
"On Monday last, we stopped to speak to hinij and asked how old he was. He
asked the day of the month, and upon being told that it was the 24th of May, replied,
with trembling lips, • I am very old—I am a hundred years old to-day.'
"His name is Oliver Cromwell, and he says that he was born at the Black Horse,
