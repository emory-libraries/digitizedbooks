History of the Black Phalanx.
right, some three-quarters of a mile, into an open cornfield, and, after
halting a few moments, turned down a road through the woods to the
left with Gen. "Wm. Birney, who ordered Col. Shaw to throw out skir¬
mishers and advance with his brigade down a road which he pointed
out, find the enemy and attack vigorously, and then rode away. Find¬
ing the road turning to the left, Col. Shaw sent word to Gen. Birney
that the designated road would probably bring him back on our own
line. The order came back from Gen. Birney to go ahead. The road
still bearing to the left, word was again sent that we should strike our
own line if we continued to advance in the direction we were going. A
second time the answer came to move on. A third messenger having
brought from Gen. Birney the same reply, Col. Shaw decided to disobey
the order and call in the skirmishers. Before it could be done firing
commenced and continued briskly for several minutes, before the men
recognized each other, and it was discovered that we had been firing
into our own Second Brigade—Col. Osborn's. This sad affair, which
would not have occurred had Col Shaw's caution been heeded, resulted
in the killing of the lieutenant commanding the picket-line and the
wounding of many men on both sides. After this fiasco the brigade
moved out into the cornfield, where it had halted earlier in the day, and
bivouacked for the night. The regiment had been more or less exposed
all day to shell-fire, but lost from it only four or five men wounded, in
addition to the ten or twelve men wounded in the skirmish with Os¬
born's brigade.
"Early on the morning of the 16th, the regiment marched back
to its knapsacks and halted for breakfast. About 10 o'clock it was
ordered out to support two batteries, and remained on this duty until
3 p. m., changing position frequently. In the meantime Gen. Terry, with
the First Division of the Tenth Corps, had charged the rebel line, near
Fuzzel's mills, and captured it, together with three colors and some
three hundred prisoners. But the enemy rallied, and with reinforce¬
ments, soon compelled Gen. Terry to relinquish the captured line.
About dark Gen. Wm. Birney came up, and taking the left wing of the
Seventh—the right wing, under Col. Shaw, was in support of a battery—
and two companies of the Ninth, placed them under command of Lieut.-
Col. Haskell, and ordered him with this handful of men to take an
earthwork in his front which a division a short time before had failed ta
carry. The timely arrival of Gen. Terry put an end to this mad scheme.
The regiment lost during the day eight or ten men wounded.
"The general results of the day's fighting had been unsatisfactory,
for not only had Terry's attack failed in its object, but the advance on
the right, along the Charles City road, by the troops of the Second
Corps and Gregg's cavalry division, had been equally unsuccessful. The
rebel General Chambliss was among the killed.
"About 2:30 a. m. of the 17th, the left wing of the regiment was sent
back to a line of rifle-pits that had been thrown up some two hundred
yards to the rear, where it was joined by the right wing in the morning
