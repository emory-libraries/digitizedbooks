"Deposition of John Nelson in relation to the capture of Fort Pillow.
"John Nelson, being duly sworn, deposeth and saith:
"' At the time of the attack on and capture of Fort Pillow, April 12,
1864,1 kept a hotel within the lines at Fort Pillow, and a short distance
from the works. Soon after tho alarm was given that an attack on the
fort was imminent, I entered the works and tendered my services to
Major Booth, commanding. The attack began in the morning at about
5% o'clock, and about 1 o'clock p. m. a flag of truce approached. During
caught them, laying the dead bodies by the roadside with pieces of paper pinned to
their clothing1, on which were written such warnings as the following: ' This is the way
we treat all nigger soldiers,' and, "this is the fate of nigger soldiers who fight against
the South.' We did not know what had been going on in onr rear until we turned
about to go back from Wytheville, when we found the dead colored soldiers along the
road as above described. General Burbridge was very angry and wanted to shoot a
Confederate prisoner for every one of his colored soldiers he found murdered, and
would undoubtedly have done so had he nqt been restrained. As it was, the whole
corps was terribly excited by the atrocious murders committed by Witcher's men, and
if Witcher had been caught he would have been shot."
This gallant soldier,(?) twenty years after the close of the war, writes about the
incidents and happenings during the march of the army to Saltville, and says:
" Before we reached Marion we encountered Breckenridge's advance and charged it
vigorously driving it back in confusion along the Marion and Saltville road for several
miles. In one of these charges (for there were several of them and a sort of running
fight for several miles) one of Witcher's men was captured and brought in. He was re¬
ported to me and I asked him what his name was and to what command he belonged.
He gave me hi's name and said 'Witcher's command.' Hardly were the words out of
his mouth before a negro soldier standing near raised his carbine and aimed at the
Confederate soldier's breast. I called out and sprang forward, but was too late to
catch the gun. The negro fired and the poor soldier fell badly wounded. Instantly the
negro was knocked down by our white soldiers, disarmed and tied. I drew my revolver
to blow his brains out for his terrible crime, but the black man never flinched. All he
said was, pointing to the Confederate soldier, 'He killed my comrades; I have killed
him.' The negro was taken away and put among the prisoners. The Provost Mar¬
shal had foolishly changed the white guard over the prisoners and placed them under
some colored troops, An officer came galloping furiously to the front and said the ne¬
groes were shooting the prisoners. General Burbridge told me to go back quickly and
do whatever I pleased in his name to restore order. It was a lively ride, as the prisoners
were more than four miles back, being forced along the road as rapidly as possible
toward Marion. All the prisoners, except a few wounded men, were on foot, and of
course they could not keep up with the cavalry. I soon reached them and never shall I
forget that sight while I live. Men with sabres were driving the poor creatures along
the road like beasts. I halted the motley crew and scolded the officer for his inhuman¬
ity. He said he had orders to keep the prisoners up with the column and he was simply
trying to obey his orders. As I was General Burbridge's chief of staff and all orders were
supposed to emanate from my oflice, I thought I had better not continue the conversa¬
tion. As It was, I said such orders were at an end and I would myself take charge of
the prisoners."
