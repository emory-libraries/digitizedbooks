378 History of the Black Phalanx.
rights and attentions were attained, was the Phalanx
allowed, to any great extent, to show its efficiency and
prowess in the manoeuvres in Virginia and vicinity, where
that magnificent "Army of Northern Virginia," the hope
and the pride of the Confederacy, was operating against
the Federal government. But when General Grant came
to direct the movements of the Eastern armies of the
United States, there was a change. He had learned from
his experience at Vicksburg and other places in his west¬
ern campaigns, that the negro soldiers were valuable;
that they could be fully relied upon in critical times, and
their patriotic zeal had made a deep impression upon him.
Therefore, as before stated, there were changes, and quite
a good many Phalanx regiments—numbering about
20,000 men—were taken from Southern and Western
armies and transferred to the different armies in Virginia.
The 19th Army Corps sent one brigade. General Gill-
more brought a brigade from the Tenth Army Corps. At
least ten thousand of them were veterans, and had driven
many confederates out of their breastworks.
The world never saw such a spectacle as America
presented in the winter and early spring of 1864. The
attempt to capture Richmond and Petersburg had failed.
The Army of the Potomac lay like a weary lion under
cover, watching its opponent. Bruised, but spirited and
defiant, it had driven, and in turn had been driven time
and again, by its equally valient foe. It had advanced
and retreated until the soldiers were foot-sore from
marching and counter-marching, crossing and re-crossing
the now historic streams of the Old Dominion. Of all
this, the loyal people were tired and demanded of the
Administration a change. The causes of the failures to
take the confederate capitol were not so much the fault of
the commanders of the brave army as that of the author¬
ities at Washington, whose indecision and interference
had entailed almost a disgrace upon McClellan, Hooker j
Burnside and Meade. But finally the people saw the
greatest of the difficulties, and demanded its removal,
which the Administration signified its willingness to do.
