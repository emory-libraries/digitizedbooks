PEEFACE.
It waB a dark, stormy night in the winter of IS 82, when less than a
hundred men, all of whom had served their country in crushing the great
Rebellion of 1861-'65, gathered around a camp-fire. The white and
the colored American were there; so were the German, Frenchman, and
Irishman,—all American -citizens,—all veterans of the last war. The
empty sleeve, the absent leg, the sabred face, the bullet-scarred body of
the many, told the story of the service they had seen. It was the annual
Encampment of the Department of Virginia, Grand Army of the Repub¬
lic, and the comrades of Farragut Post had tastefully arranged their
quarters for the occasion.
At midnight a sumptuous soldiers fare—baked beans, not coffee and
hard tack—was spread before the veterans, who ate and drank heartily
as in the days when resting from the pursuit of the enemy. In the morn¬
ing hour, when weary from the joy of song and toast, it was proposed
that the history of the American negro soldier should be written, that
posterity might have a fuller and more complete record of the deeds of
the negro soldiers than had been given in the numerous already pub¬
lished histories of the conflicts in which they played so important a part.
The task of preparing the history fell to my lot, and it is in obedience
to the duty laid upon me by my former comrades, with whom I shared
the toils and joys of camp, march, battle and siege, that this volume,
the result of my efforts, is launched upon the sea of war literature.
Whether or not there is any merit in the work, (the reader must judge.
His charity is asked, however, toward such defects as may be apparent,
and which, perhaps, might be expected in the literary work of one whose
life has been largely spent amid the darkness of the South American
countries and the isolation of the South Sea Islands. It was not until
May, 1862, while domiciled at the capitol of Chili, that I first learned of
the war in the United States, when, hastening to this country, I fell into
the ranks with the first negro soldiers that left the Touro Building at
New Orleans, in November, 1862, and marched out on the Opelousas
road, to serve in defence of the Union.
"With whatever foreboings of failure I entered upon the work of
collecting the literature of the war, from which to cull and arrange much
of the matter contained herein,—which has required years of incessant
