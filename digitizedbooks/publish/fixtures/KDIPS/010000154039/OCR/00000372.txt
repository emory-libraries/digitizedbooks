History of the Black Phalanx.
and knowing the importance of the fcross-roads to us, I directed him in
case he should be overpowered, to fall back slowly toward the cross¬
roads, thus contracting his line and strengthening his position. I was
especially anxious on this point because through some misunderstand¬
ing, that I am yet unable to explain, the cavalry had been withdrawn
without my knowledge from the left, and I was compelled to occupy the
line, temporarily, with my escort, consisting of about 100 of the 19th
Penn. Cavalry. This handful of troops under the gallant Lieut-Colonel
Hess, behaved very handsomely and held the line until the arrival of the
infantry. About half-past 1 p. m. the infantry began to arrive. Col.
Hodge's brigade was the first to reach the field and was placed in posi¬
tion by Colonel McMilleu, when the enemy was driven a little. General
Grierson now requested authority to withdraw the entire cavalry as it
was exhausted and well nigh out of ammunition. This I authorized as
soon as sufficient infantry was in position to permit it and he was
directed to reorganize his command in the rear and hold it ready to
operate on the flanks. In the mean time I had ordered a section of
artillery to be placed in position on a knoll near the little bridge, some
three or four hundred yards in the rear, for the purpose of opposing
any attempt of the enemy to turn our left. I now went to this point
to see that my orders had been executed and also to give directions for
the management and protection of the wagon-train. I found the sec¬
tion properly posted and supported by the*72nd Ohio Infantry, with two
companies thrown forward as skirmishers, and the whole under the
superintendence of that excellent officer, Colonel Wilkins, of the 9th
Mmn. While here, the head of the wagon train, which had been reported
still a mile and a half in rear, arrived. It was immediately ordered into
an open field near where the cavalry were reorganizing, there to be
turned round and carried farther toward the rear. The pressure on the
right of the line was now becoming very great and General Grierson
was directed to send a portion of his cavalry to that point. At this
time I received a message from Colonel Hodge that he was satisfied that
the movement on the right was a feint and that the real attack was
being made on the left. Another section of artillery was now placed in
position a little to the rear of Colonel Wilkins, but bearing on the left of
our main line, and a portion of the cavalry was thrown out as skirmish¬
ers The cavalry which had been sent to the extreme right began now
to give way, and at the same time the enemy began to appear in force in
rear of the extreme left, while Colonel McMillen required re-enforcements
in the centre. 1 now endeavored to get hold of the colored brigade
which formed the guard to the train. While traversing the short dis¬
tance to where the head of that brigade should be found, the main line
began to give way at various points; order soon gave way to confusion
and confusion to panic. I sent an aid to Col. McMillen informing him
that I was unable to render him any additional assistance, and that he
must do all in his power with what he had to hold his position until I
could form a line to protect his retreat. On reaching the head of the
