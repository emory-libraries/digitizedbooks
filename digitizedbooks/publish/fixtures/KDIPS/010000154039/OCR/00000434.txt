432 History of the Black Phalanx.
"It began to rain in the afternoon and continued during the night
and until nearly noon of the following day, 20th. During the afternoon
of the 20th, orders were received to send all sick to the rear and be
ready to withdraw quietly at dark. The movement began at 7 P. M.,
both the Second and Tenth Corps participating—the Second Corps and
the cavalry returning to the Petersburg line, and the Tenth to the Ber¬
muda Hundred front. The night was dark and the roads muddy, and
after various delays the pontoons were crossed; and at 2 a. m., the regi¬
ment went into camp near the spot it occupied the first night after its
arrival in Virginia.
"An amusing incident occurred when we halted, after crossing the
river. When the fires were lighted our line presented the appearance of
a checker-board—alternate black and white men. The latter belonged
to the Second Corps, and having straggled from their commands, and
belonging to regiments with the same numbers, had fallen into our
solid ranks by mistake. Their astonishment and our amusement were
about equal. Capt. Walker, having been asked if his men were all pres¬
ent, replied: 'Yes, and about twenty recruits.'
"Thus ended a very hard week's work, during which the regiment
was almost constantly under fire; marching, counter-marching, support¬
ing a battery here or strengthening the line there—duties which required
almost constant wakefulness and watchfulness. The losses of the brig¬
ade footed up some two hundred and fifty.
" This movement, which had begun on the 12th by the withdrawal
of the Second Corps, Gen. Hancock, and Gregg's cavalry division, from
the Petersburg front to the north bank of the James, to act in conjunc¬
tion with the Tenth Corps in an attempt to turn the left of the rebel
line, proved as abortive as the similar attempt made by the same corps
in the latter part of June; Gen. Lee, in both instances, seeming to have
received timely information of our plans to enable him to transfer re-en¬
forcements from the Petersburg to the Richmond front. The Union
losses during the movement have been estimated at five thousand.
" Sunday, the 21st, was a day of rest. The men put up shelter
tents and made themselves as comfortable as circumstances would
allow. Gen. Birney resumed command of the brigade and Col. Shaw
returned to the regiment. About 6 p. m. orders came to be ready to
move during the night with one day's rations. Moved out of camp at
2 a. m., 22nd, and reported at Maj.-Gen. Birney's headquarters, where,
after remaining a short time, the regiment returned to camp. About 3
p. m. orders were received to pack everything, and at 5 the regiment
marched to the front and went into the trenches near Battery Walker,
(No. 7), relieving a regiment of hundred-days' men, whose time had
expired.
"The 23d passed quietly. Tents were pitched, and in the evening
a dress-parade was held. Lieut. Mack returned to duty from absent sick
" Line was formed at dawn on the 24th, and again about noon
rapid picket-firing in each instance rendering an attack probable.
