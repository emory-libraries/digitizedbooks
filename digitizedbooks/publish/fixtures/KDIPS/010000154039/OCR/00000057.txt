The War of 1775.
55
To speak of the gallantry of the negro soldiers recalls
the recollection of some of their daring deeds at Red
Bank, where four hundred men met and repulsed, after a
terrible, sanguinary struggle, fifteen hundred Hessian
troops led by Count Donop.
" The glory of the defence of Red Bank, which has been pronounced
one of the most heroic actions of the war, belongs in reality to black
men; yet who now hears them spoken of in connection with it? Among
the traits which distinguished the black regiment was devotion to their
officers. In the attack made upon the American lines, near Croton river,
on the 13th of May, 1781, Col. Greene, the commander of the regiment,
was cut down and mortally wounded; but the sabres of the enemy only
reached him through the bodies of his faithful blacks, who gathered
around him to protect him, and every one of whom was killed."
Now the negro began to take the field; not scattered here
and there throughout the army, filling up the shattered
ranks of white regiments, but in organizations composed
entirely of men of their own race, officered, however, by
white officers, men of high social and military character
and standing. The success of the measure in Rhode
Island, emboldened the effort in Massachusetts, where the
advocates of separate negro organizations had been labor¬
ing zealously for its accomplishment. Officers of the
army in the field, expressed their desire to be placed in
command of negro troops, in separate and distinct organ¬
izations. Every effort, however, up to tfyis time to induce
Massachusetts to consent to the proposition had failed.
Rhode Island alone sent her negro regiments to the field,
whose gallantry during the war more than met the most
sanguine expectations of their warmest friends, and fully
merited the trust and confidence of the State and country.
As the struggle proceeded, re-enforcements were more fre¬
quently in demand; but recruits were scarce, and the ques¬
tion of arming negroes became again prominent in the
colonies and the army.
In April, 1778, Thomas Kench, then serving in an
artillery regiment, addressed letters to the Massachusetts
Legislature urging the enlistment of negroes. He wrote:
"A re-enforcement can quickly be raised of two or three hundred
men. Will your honors grant the liberty, and give me the command of
