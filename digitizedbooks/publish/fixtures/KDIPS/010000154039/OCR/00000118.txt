such condition o/ things as that. But, before we had invoked this for¬
eign despotism, we would arm every man and boy that we have in the
land, ahd we would meet you in a death-struggle, to overthrow together
such an oppression and our oppressors." Mr. Rice remarked in reply to
Mr. Davis, "The rebels hesitate at nothing. There are no means that
God or the Devil has given them that they do not Tjse. The honorable
senator said that the negroes might be useful in loading and swabbing
a«d firing cannon. If that be the case, may not some of them be useful
in loading, swabbing, and firing the musket?"
On the 10th of February, 1864, Mr. Stevens (Republi¬
can) of Pennsylvania, in the House of Representatives,
moved an amendment to the Enrollment Act. Says the
same authority before quoted:
The Enrollment Bill was referred to a Conference Committee, consist¬
ing of Mr. Wilson of Massachusetts, Mr. Nesmet of Oregon, and Mr.
Grimes of Iowa, on the part of the Senate; and Mr. Schenck of Ohio, Mr.
Deming of Connecticut, and Mr. Kernan of New York, on the part of
the House. In the Conference Committee, Mr. "Wilson stated that he

slave of a loyal master shall Be drafted and mustered into the service of
the United States, his master shall have a certificate thereof; and there¬

payable by law for each drafted man, shall be paid to the person to
whom such drafted person was owing service or labor at the time of his
muster into the service of the United States. The Secretary of War
shall appoint a commission in each of the slave States represented in
Congress, charged to award, to each loyal person to whom a colored
volunteer may owe service, a just compensation, not exceeding three
hundred dollars, for each such colored volunteer, payable out of the

being mustered into the service, shall be free."
The report of the Conference Committee was agreed to; and it was
■enacted that every slave, whether a drafted man or a volunteer, shall be
free on being mustered into the military service of the United States, not
by the act of the master, but by the authority of the Federal Govern¬
