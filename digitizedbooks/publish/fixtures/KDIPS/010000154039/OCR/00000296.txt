294 History of the Black Phalanx.
that time a reward could be claimed for returning fugitive slaves. I
took charge of them, and assuming a stern look and manner, enquired,
'Where are you going?' 'Going to the Yankee army.' 'What for?'
'We wants to be free, sir.' 'All right, you are free, go where you wish.'
The satisfaction that came to me from their heartfelt' thank'ee, thank'ee
sir,' gave me some faint insight into the sublime joy that the great
emancipator must have felt when he penned the immortal proclamation
that set free four millions of human beings.
" These men afterward enlisted in my regiment, and did good service.
One day, as we were on the march, they—through their lieutenant—re¬
minded me of the circumstance, which they seemed to remember with
lively gratitude.
"The six companies at Bridgeport were kept very busily at work,
and had but little opportunity for drill. Notwithstanding these difficul¬
ties, however, considerable progress was made in both drill and discip¬
line. I made earnest efforts to get the regiment united and relieved from
so much labor, in order that they might be prepared for efficient field
service as soldiers.
"In January I had a personal interview with General Thomas, and
secured an order uniting the regiment at Chattanooga. We entered
camp there under the shadow of Lookout Mountain, and in full view of
Mission Ridge, in February, 1864. During the same month Adjutant Gen¬
eral Lorenzo Thomas, from Washington, then on a tour of inspection,
Visited my regiment, and authorized me to substitute the eagle for the
silver leaf.
"Chattanooga was at that time the headquarters of the Army of
the Cumberland. Gen Thomas and staff, and a considerable part of the
army were there. Our camp was laid out with great regularity; our quar¬
ters were substantial, comfortable and well kept. The regiment num¬
bered a thousand men, with a full compliment of field, staff, line and
non-commissioned officers. We had a good drum corps, and a band pro¬
vided with a set of expensive silver instruments. We were also fully
equipped; the men were armed with riflpd muskets, and well clothed.
They were well drilled in the manual of arms, and took great pride in
appearing on parade with arms burnished, belts polished, shoes blacked,
clothes brushed, in full regulation uniform, including white gloves. On
every pleasant day our parades were witnessed by officers, soldiers and
citizens from the North, and it was not uncommon to have two thou¬
sand spectators. Some came to make sport, some from curiosity, some
because it was the fashion, and others from a genuine desire to see for
themselves what sort of looking soldiers negroes would make.
"At the time that the work of organizing colored troops began in
the West, there was a great deal of bitter prejudice against the move¬
ment, and white troops threatened to desert, if the plan should be really
carried out. Those who entered the service were stigmatized as 'nigger
officers,' and negro soldiers were hooted at and mal-treated by white
ones.
