At length the period for its introduction arrived. Lee
in his attempted invasion of the north made no more
careful preparations than did Mr. Davis and his cabinet
to carry through Congress the bill enrolling slaves and to
emancipate them. Finally the hour was at hand, and
amid the mutteringsof dissenters, and threats of members
to resign their seats if the measure was" forced through,

weakness. However, it stood by the carefully drawn bill.
Of course the negro people about the city of Richmond

President Davis and his cabinet. Emissaries of Mr. Davis

Monroe, where they met representatives of the United
States government, and learned that the conditions upon
which the Southern States could resume their relations
were those which they were compelled to accept finally.
During Mr. Benjamin's speech he said:
"We have 680,000 blacks capable of bearing arms, and who ought
now to be in the field. Let us now say to every negro who wishes to go
into the ranks on condition of being free, go and fight—you are free.
My own negroes have been to me and said, 'Master, set us free and we'll
