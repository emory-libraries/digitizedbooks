204 Histoky of the Black Phalanx.
be shown them or not. The knowledge this little garri¬
son had of what the morrow would bring it, doubtless
kept the soldiers awake, preparing to meet the enemy and
their own fate. About 3 o'clock, in the early grey of the
morning, the confederate line was formed just outside of the
intrenchments; suddenly with fixed bayonets the men came
rushing over the works, driving everything before them
and shouting, "No quarter! No quarter to negroes or
their officers!" In a moment the blacks formed and
met them, and now the battle began in earnest, hand to
hand. The gunboats "Choctaw" and "Lexington" also
came up as the confederates were receiving the bayonets
and the bullets of the Unionists, and lent material assist¬
ance. The attacking force had flanked the works and
was pouring in a deadly, enfilading musketry lire. The
defenders fell back out of the way of the gunboat's shells,
but finally went forward again with what was left of their
150 white allies, and drove the enemy before them and
out of the oaptured works. One division of the enemy's
troops hesitated to leave a redoubt, when a company of
brave black men dashed forward at double-quick time and
engaged them. The enemy stood his ground, and soon
the rattling bayonets rang out amid the thunders of the
gunboats and the shouts of enraged men; but they were
finally driven out, and their ranks thinned by the "Choc¬
taw" as they went over the works. The news reached
General Graht and he immediately dispatched General
Mower's brigade with orders to re-enforce Dennis and
drive the confederates beyond the Tensas river.
A battle can be best described by one who observed it.
Captain Miller, who not only was an eye-witness, but par¬
ticipated in the Milliken's Bend fight, writes as follows:
"We were attacked here on June 7, about three o'clock in the morning by a brig¬
ade of Texas troops, about two thousand Ave hundred in number. We had about six
hundred men to withstand them, five hundred of them negroes. I commanded Com¬
pany I, Ninth Louisiana. We went into the fight with thirty-three men. I had sixteen
killed, eleven badly wounded, and four slightly. I was wounded slightly on the head
near the right eye, with a bayonet, and had a bayonet run through my right hand'
near the fprefinger; that will account for this miserable siyle of penmanship '
"Our regiments had about three hundred men in the fight. We had one colonel
wounded, four captains wounded, two first and two second lieutenants killed five lieu¬
tenants wounded, and three white orderlies killed, and one wounded in the hand and
two fingers taken off. The list of killed and wounded officers comprised nearly ail the
officers present with the regiment, a majority of the rest being absent recruiting
"We had about fifty men killed in the regiment and eighty wounded; so you can
judge of what part of the light my company sustained. I never felt more grieved and
