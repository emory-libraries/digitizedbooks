ard-bearer. The retreating force reached their transport
with the loss of only one man; they brought with them
some prisoners and captured flags. Colonel Daniels, in
his report, speaks as follows of the heroism of the soldiers:
»#»»*•
" The expedition was a perfect success, accomplishing; all that was intended; result¬
ing in the repulse of the enemy in every engagement with great loss; whilst our casualty
■was only two killed and eight wounded. Great credit is due to the troops engaged, for
their unflinching bravery and steadiness under this their first fire, exchanging volley
after volley with the coolness of veterans; and for their determined tenacity in main¬
taining their position, and taking advantage of every success that their courage and
valor gave them; and also to their officers, who were cool and determined throughout
the action, fighting their commands against five times their numbers, and confident
throughout of success,—all demonstrating to its fullest extent that the oppres¬
sion which they have heretofore undergone from the hands of their foes, and the oblo¬
quy that had been showered Upon them by those who should have been friends, had
not extinguished their manhood, or suppressed their bravery, and that they had still a
kand to wield the sword, and a heart to vitalize its blow.
"I would particularly call the attention of the Department to Major F. E. Dumas,
Capt. Villeverd, and Lieuts. Jones and Martin, who were constantly in the thickest of
the fight, and by their unflinching bravery, and admirable handling of their com¬
mands, contributed to the success of the attack, and reflected great honor upon the
flag under and [for which they so nobly struggled. Repeated instances of individual
bravery among the troops [might be mentioned; but it would be .invidious where all
fought so manfully and so well.

The 2nd Regiment, with the exception of the Colonel,
Lieut.-Colonel and Adjutant, was ofBcered by negroes,
many of whom had worn the galling chains of slavery,
while others were men of affluence and culture from New
Orleans and vicinity.
The 2nd Regiment had its full share of prejudice to
contend with, aiid perhaps suffered more from that cause
than any other regiment of the Phalanx. Once while load¬
ing transports at Algiers, preparatory to embarking for
Ship Island, they came in contact with a section of the
famous Nim's battery, rated as one of the finest in the ser¬
vice. The arms of the 2nd Regiment were stacked and
the men were busy in loading the vessel, save a few who
were doing guard duty over the ammunition stored in a
shed on the wharf. One of the battery-men attempted to
enter the shed with a, lighted pipe in his mouth, but was
prevented by the guard. It was more than the Celt could
stand to be ordered b^ a negro; watching for a chance
when the guard about-faced, he with several others sprang
upon him. The guard gave the Phalanx signal, and in¬
stantly hundreds of black men secured their arms and
rushed to the relief of their comrade. The battery-men
