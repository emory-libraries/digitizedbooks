every able-bodied black man in the department to fight for the freedom
which could not but be the issue of our war.'
This resolution being taken, was immediately acted upon with vigor,
the General causing all the necessary orders to be issued, and takijig
upon himself, as his private burden, the responsibility for all the irregu¬
lar issues of arms, clothing, equipments, and rations involved in collect¬
ing and organizing the first experimental negro regiment. The men he
intended to pay, at first, by placing them as laborers on the pay-roll of
the Chief Quartermaster; but it was his hope that the obvious necessity
and wisdom of the measure he had thus presumed to adopt without au¬
thority, would secure for it the immediate approval of the higher author¬
ities, and the necessary orders to cover the required pay and supply-issue
of the force he had in contemplation. If his course should be endorsed
by the War Department, well and good; if it were not so indorsed, why,
he had enough property of his own to pay back to the Government all
he was irregularly expending in this experiment.
" But now, on the very threshhold of this novel enterprise, came the
first—and it was not a trivial—difficulty. Where could experienced offi¬
cers be found for such an organization? 'What! command niggers?' was
the reply—if possible more amazed than scornful—of nearly every com¬
petent young lieutenant or captain of volunteers to whom the sugges¬
tion of commanding this class of troops was made. ' Never mind,' said
Hunter, when this trouble was brought to his notice; 'the fools or bigots
who refuse are enough punished by their refusal. Before two years they
will be competing eagerly for the commission they now reject.' Straight-
ly there was issued a circular to all commanding officers in the depart¬
ment, directing them to announce to the non-commissioned officers and
men of their respective commands that commissions in the ' South Caro¬
lina Regiment of Colored Infantry,' would be given to all deserving and
reputable sergeants, corporals; and m6n who would appear at depart¬
ment headquarters, and prove able to pass an examination in the man¬
ual and tactics before a Band of Examiners, which was organized in a
general order of current date. Capt. Arthur M. Kenzie, of Chicago, aid-
de-camp,—now of Hancock's Veterans Reserve Corps—was detailed as
Colonel of the regiment, giving place, subsequently, in consequence of
injured health, to the present Brig.-Gen. James D. Fessenden, then a
captain in the Berdan Sharpshooters, though detailed as acting aid-de¬
camp on Gen. Hunter's staff. Capt. Kenzie, we may add, was Gen. Hun¬
ter's nephew, and his appointment as Colonel was made partly to prove
—so violent was then the prejudice against negro troops—that the Com¬
manding General asks nothing of them which he was not willing that
one of his own flesh and blood should be engaged in.
"The work was now fairly in progress, but the barriers of prejudice
were not to be lightly overthrown. Non-commissioned officers and men
of the right stamp, and able to pass the examination requisite, were
scarce articles. Ten had the hardihood or moral courage to face the
