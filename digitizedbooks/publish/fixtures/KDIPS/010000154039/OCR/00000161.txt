rebels may justly claim to be considered a most unjustly treated body of disinterested
patriots,—although, perhaps, a little mistaken in your connivance with the thefts by
which your agent, John B. Floyd, succeeded in arming the South and partially disarm¬
ing the North as a preparative to the commencement of the struggle.
" But if on the other hand—as is the theory of our Government—the war you have
levied against the U. S. be a rebellion the most causeless, crafty and bloody ever known,
—a conspiracy having the rule-or-ruin policy for its basis; the plunder of the black race
and the reopening of the African slave trade for its object, the continued and further
degradation of ninety per cent, of the white population of the South in favor of a slave
driving ten per cent, aristocracy, and the exclusion of all foreign-born immigrants from
participation in the generous and equal hospitality foreshadowed to them in the Decla¬
ration of Independence,—if this, as I believe, be a fair statement of the origin and mo¬
tives of the rebellion of which you are the titular head, then it would have been better
had our Government adhered to the constitutional view of treason from the start, and
hung every man taken in arms against the U. S. from the first butchery in the streets of
Baltimore, down to the last resultless battle fought in the vicinity of Sharpsburg, If
treason, in other words, be any crime, it is the essence of all crimes; a vast machinery
of guilt, multiplying assassinations into wholesale slaughter, and organizing plunder
as the basis for supporting a system of National Brigandage. Tour action, and that
of those with whom you are in league, has its best comment in the sympathy extended
to your cause by the despots and aristocracies of Europe. You have succeeded in
throwing back civilization for many years; and have made of the country that was the
freest, happiest, proudest, richest, and most progressive but two short years ago, a
vast temple of mourning, doubt, anxiety and privation ■ our manufactories of all but
war material nearly paralyzed; the inventive spirit which was forever developing new re¬
sources destroyed, and our flag, that carried respect everywhere, now mocked by
enemies who think its glory tarnished, and that its power is soon to become a mere tra¬
dition of the past.
" For all these results, Mr. Davis, and for the three hundred thousand lives already
sacrificed on both sides in the war—some pouring out their blood on the battle-field,
and others fever stricken and wasting away to death in overcrowded hospitals—you
and the fellow miscreants who have been your associates in this conspiracy are respon¬
sible. Of you and them it may, with truth be said, that if all the innocent blood
which you have spilled could be collected in one pool, the whole government of your
Confederacy might swim in it.
"I am aware that this is not the language in which the prevailing etiquette of our
army is in the habit of considering your conspiracy. It has come to pass—through
■what instrumentalities you are best able to decide—that the greatest and worst crime
■ever attempted against the human family, has been treated in certain quarters as
though it were a mere error of judgment on the part of some gifted friend; a thing to
be regretted, of course, as causing more or less disturbance to the relation of amity
and esteem heretofore existing between those charged -with the repression of such eccen¬
tricities and the eccentric actors; in fact, as a slight political miscalculation or pecca¬
dillo, rather than as an outrage involving the desolation of a continent, and demand¬
ing the promptest and severest retribution within power of human law.
" For myself, I have never been able to take this view of the matter. During a life¬
time of active service, I have seen the seeds of this conspiracy planted in the rank soil
of slavery, and the upas-growth watered by just such tricklings of a courtesy alike false
to justice, expediency, and our eternal future. Had we at an earlier day commenced to
call things by their right names, and to look at the hideous features of slavery with
our ordinary eyesight and common sense, instead of through the rose-oolored glasses
of supposed political expediency, there would be three hundred thousand more men
alive to-day on American soil; and our country would never for a moment have for¬
feited her proud position as the highest exampler of the blessings—morals, intellectual
and material—to be derived from a free form of government.
" Whether your intention of hanging me and those of my staff and other officers
who were engaged in organizing the 1st S. C. Volunteers, in case we are taken prison¬
ers in battle, will be likely to benefit your cause or not, is a matter mainly for your
