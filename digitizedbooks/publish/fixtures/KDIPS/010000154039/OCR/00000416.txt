414 History of the Black Phalanx.
the whispered word of command, looked for the eventful
moment of attack to arrive. A quarter of an hour
passed,—a half hour, yet there was no report. Four
o'clock, and the sky began to brighten in the east; the
confederate garrison was bestirring itself. The enemy's^
lines once more assumed the appearance of life; the sharp¬
shooters, prepared for their victims, began to pick off
those of our men, who came within range of their deadly
aim. Another day of siege was drawing on, and still
there was no explosion. What could it mean? The fuses
had failed,—the dampness having penetrated to the place

still more impatient, and was on the point of ordering an
immediate assault upon the enemy's works, without refer¬
ence to the mine. Five minutes later he did order an
assault. General Grant was there when, at sixteen min¬
utes before five o'clock, the mine exploded. Then ensued
a scene which beggars description.
General Badeau, in describing the spectacle, says :
" The mine exploded with a shock like that of an earthquake, tear¬
ing up the rebels' work above them, and vomiting men, guns and cala-
