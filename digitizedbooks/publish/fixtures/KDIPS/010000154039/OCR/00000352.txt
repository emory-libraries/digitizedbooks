350 History of the Black Phalanx.
timbered bluff on the Mississippi river, with a ravine on
either hand. A federal gunboat, the "New Era," assisted
in the defence, but the height of the bluff prevented her
giving material support to the garrison. In the after¬
noon both sides ceased firing, to cool and clean their guns.
During this time, Forrest, under a flag of truce, sum¬
moned the federals to surrender within a half hour. Major
Bradford refused to comply with the demand. Meantime
the confederates taking advantage of the truce to secret
themselves down in a ravine, from whence they could rush
upon the Fort at a given signal. No sooner was Brad¬
ford's refusal to surrender received, than the confederates
rushed simultaneously into the Fort. In a moment almost
the place was in their possession. The garrison, throwing
away their arms fled down the steep banks, endeavoring
to hide from the promised "no quarter," which Forrest
had embodied in his demand for surrender: "If I have to
storm your works, you may expect no quarter." The
confederates followed, "butchering black and white sol¬
diers and non-combatants, men, women and children.
Disabled men were made to stand up and be shot; others
were burned within the tents wherein they had been nailed
to the floor." This carnival of murder continued until
dark, and was even renewed the next morning. Major
Bradford was not murdered until he had been carried as a
prisoner several miles on the retreat.
It is best that the evidence in this matter, as given
in previous pages of this chapter, should be read. It is
unimpeachable, though Forrest, S. D. Lee and Chalmers
have attempted to deny the infernal work. The last
named, under whose command these barbarous acts were
committed, offered on the floor of the United States Con¬
gress, fifteen years afterward, an apologetic denial of
what appears from the evidence of those who escaped,
—taken by the Congressional Committee,—and also con¬
tradictory to the confederate General S. D. Lee's report, in
which he fails to convince himself even of the inaccuracy
of the reports of brutality, as made by the few who es¬
caped being murdered. Lee says:
