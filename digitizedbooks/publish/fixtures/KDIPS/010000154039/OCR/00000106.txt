required. In any other country than our own such a draft could not be
met, but the Southern States can furnish that number of men, and still
not leave the material interests of the country in a suffering condition.
Those who are incapacitated for bearing arms can oversee the planta¬
tions, and the negroes can go on undisturbed in their usual labors. In
the North the case is different; the men who join the army of subjuga¬
tion are the laborers, the producers, and the factory operatives. Nearly
every man from that sectidn, especially those from the rural districts,
leaves some branch of industry to suffer during his absence. The institu¬
tion of slavery in the South alone enables her to place in the field a force
much larger in proportion to her white population than the North, or
indeed any country which is dependent entirely on free labor. The insti¬
tution is a tower of strength to the South, particularly at the present
crisis, and our enemies will be likely to find that the 'moral cancer' about
which their orators are so fond of prating, is really one of the most
effective weapons employed against the Union by the South. Whatever
number of men may be needed for this war, we are confident our people
stand ready to furnish. We are all enlisted for the war, and there must
be no holding back until the independence of the South is fully acknowl¬
edged." *
The facts already noted became apparent to the nation
very soon, and then came a change of procedure, and the
war began to be prosecuted upon quite a different policy.
Gen. McClellan, whose loyalty to the new policy was
doubted, was removed from the command of the Army of
the Potomac, and slave catching ceased. The XXXYII
Congress convened in Dec. 1861, in its second session, and
passed the following additional article of war:
"All officers are prohibited from employing any of the forces under
their respective commands for the purpose of returning fugitives from
service or labor who may have escaped from any persons to whom such
service or labor is claimed to be due. Any officer who shall be found
guilty by court-martial of violating this article shall be dismissed from
the service."
This was the initatory measure of the new policy,
which progressed to its fulfillment rapidly. And then
what Mr. Cameron, Secretary of War, had recommended
in December. 1861, and to which the President objected,
very soon developed, through a series of enactments, in
the arming of the negro; in which the loyal people of the
whole country acquiesced, save the border states people,
who fiercely opposed it as is shown in the conduct of Mr.
