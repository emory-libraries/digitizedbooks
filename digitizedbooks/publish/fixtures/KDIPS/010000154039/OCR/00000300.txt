History of the Black Phalanx.
incidents will indicate the significance of the day. Just before going into
the fight, Lieutenant Keinborts said to his men: 'Boys, some of you
may be killed, but remember you are fighting for liberty.' Henry Prince
replied,' I am ready to die for liberty.' In fifteen minutes he lay dead,—
a rifle ball through his heart,—a willing martyr.
" During the engagement General Steadman asked his Aide, Captain
Davis, to look especially after the 14th colored. Captain Davis rode up
just as I was quietly rectifying my line, which in a charge had been dis¬
arranged. Putting spurs to his horse, he dashed back to the General
and reassured him by reporting that ' the regiment was holding dress
parade over there under fire.' After the fight, as we marched into town
through a pouring rain, a white regiment standing at rest, swung their
hats and gave three rousing cheers for the 14th Colored. Col. Streight's
command was so pleased with the gallantry of our men that many of
its members on being asked, ' What regiment ?' frequentlyreplied, ' 51st
Colored.'
"During the month of August we had some very hard marching, in
a vain effort to have another brush with Wheeler's cavalry.
"The corn in East Tennessee was in good plight for roasting, and
our men showed great facility in cooking, and marvelous capacity in de¬
vouring it. Ten large ears were not too much for many of them. On
resuming our march one day, after the noon halt, one of the soldiers said
he was unable to walk, and asked permission to ride in an ambulance.
His comrades declared that, having already eaten twelve ears of corn,
and finding himself unable to finish the thirteenth, he concluded that he
must be sick, and unfit for duty.
" Pulaski, Tenn.—September 27th, 1864, I reported to Major-Gen-
eral Rousseau, commanding a force of cavalry at Pulaski, Tenn. As we
approached the town by rail from Nashville, we heard artillery, then
musketry, and as we left the cars we saw the smoke of guns. Forest,
with a large body of cavalry, had been steadily driving Rousseau before
him all day, and was destroying the railroad. Finding the General, I
said: 'I am ordered to report to you, sir.' 'What have you?' 'Two
regiments of colored troops.' Rousseau was a Kentuckian, and had not
much faith in negro soldiers. By his direction I threw out a strong line
of skirmishers, and posted the regiments on a ridge, in good supporting
distance. Rousseau's men retired behind my line, and Forest's men
pressed forward until they met our fire, and recognizing the sound of the
minie ball, stopped to reflect.
"The massacre of colored troops at Fort Pillow was well known to
us, and had been fully discussed by our men. It was rumored, and thor¬
oughly credited by them, that General Forest had offered a thousand
dollars for the head of any commander of a 'nigger regiment.' Here,
then, was just such an opportunity as those spoiling for a fight might
desire. Negro troops stood face to face with Forest's veteran cavalry.
The fire was growing hotter, and balls were uncomfortably thick. At
length, the enemy in strong force, with banners flying, bore down toward
