History of the Black Phalanx.
house in Union Street, and Gray, from his brother's, in Boyal Exchange
Lane. The four hearses formed a junction in King Street, and then the
procession marched in columns six deep, with a long file of coaches
belonging to the most distinguished citizens, to the Middle Burying
Ground, where the four victims were deposited in one grave; over which
a stone was placed with the inscription:
'Long as in Freedom's cause the wise contend,
Dear to your country shall your fame extend;
While to the world the lettered stone shall tell
Where Caldwell, Attucks, Gray and Maverick fell.'
" The anniversary of this event was publicly commemorated in Bos¬
ton by an oration and other exercises every year until our National
Independence was achieved, when the Fourth of July was substituted
for the Fifth of March, as the more proper day for a general celebration.
Not only was the event commemorated, but the martyrs who then gave

Thus the first blood for liberty shed in the colonies
was that of a real slave and a negro. As the news of the
affray spread , the people became aroused throughout the
land. Soon, in every town and village, meetings were

years in the Southern States. Their war-like courage, it is
true, had been slackened, but their manhood had not
been crushed.
Crispus Attucks was a fair representative of the colo¬

longed struggle which resulted in the Independence of the
United States. When the tocsin sounded "to arms, to
arms, ye who would be free," the negro responded to the
call, and side by side with the white patriots of the Colo¬

Mr. Bancroft in his history of the United States says:
"Nor should history forget to record, that as in the army at Cam¬
bridge, so also in this gallant band, the free negroes of the colony had
