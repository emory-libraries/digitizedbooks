History of the Black Phalanx.
"James "Walls, sworn and examined. By Mr. Gooch:
'Question. To what company did you belong? 'Answer. Company
E, 13th Tennessee cavalry.
' Question. Under what officers did you serve ? 'Answer. I was un¬
der Major Bradford and Captain Potter.
'Question. "Were you in the fight at Fort Pillow? 'Answer. Yes,
«ir.
'Question. State what you saw there of the fight, and what was
done after the place was captured. 'Answer. We fought them for some
•six or eight hours in the fort, and when they charged, our men scattered
and ran under the hill; some turned back and surrendered, and were
shot. After the flag of truce came in I went down to get some water.
As I was coming back I turned sick, and laid down behind a log. The se-
cesh charged, and after they came over I saw one go a good ways ahead
of the others. One of our men made to him and threw down his arms.
The bullets were flying so thick there I thought I could not live there, so
I threw down my arms and surrendered. He did not shoot me then, but
as I turned around he or some other one shot me in the back.
'Question. Did they say anything while they were shooting? 'An¬
swer. All I heard was, 'Shoot him, shoot him!' 'Yonder goes one I'
* Kill him, kill him!' That is about all I heard.
' Question. How many do you suppose you saw shot after they sur¬
rendered? 'Answer. I did not see but two or three shot around me.
One of the boys of our company, named Taylor, ran up there, and I saw
him shot and fall. Then another was shot just before me, like—shot
•down after he threw down his arms.
'Question. Those were white men? 'Answer. Yes, sir. I saw them
•make lots of niggers stand up, and then they shot them down like hogs.
The next morning I was lying around there waiting for the boat to come
up. The secesh would be prying around there, and would come to a
Digger and say, 'You ain't dead are you?' They would not say any¬
thing, and then the secesh would get down off their horses, prick them
in their sides, and say, ' D—n you, you aint dead; get up.' Then they
•would make them get up on their knees, when they would shoot them
down like hogs.
'Question. Do you know of their burning any buildings? 'Answer.
I could hear them tell them to stick torches all around, and they fired all
the buildings.
' Question. Do you know whether any of our men were in the build¬
ings when they were burned? 'Answer. Some of our men said some
were burned; I did not see it, or know it to be so myself.
'Question. How did they bury them—white and black together?
^Answer. I don't know about the burying; I did not see any buried.
' Question. How many negroes do you suppose were killed after the
surrender? 'Answer. There were hardly any killed before the surrender.
I reckon as many as 200 were killed after the surrender, out of about
300 that were there. •
