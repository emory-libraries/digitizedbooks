fight for you.' You must make up your minds to try this or see your
army withdrawn from before your town. I know not where white men
can be found."
Mr. Benjamin's speech created an intense excitement
among the slave-holders. The situation seemed to have
narrowed itself down to a disagreeable alternative. They
must either fight themselves or let the slaves fight.
Doubtless many would have preferred submission to Lin¬
coln, but then they could not save their slaves. Immedi¬
ately following Mr. Benjamin's speech on the 11th, a bill
was introduced into the House of Representatives author¬
izing the enlistment of 200,000 slaves, with the consent of
their owners. As a test of its strength a motion was
made for the rejection of this bill, and the vote not to
reject it was more than two to one. There was every
indication that the bill would pass. It was while this
measure was under discussion that General Lee wrote the
letter which follows in answer to one of inquiry from a
member of the House:

the 12th inst. with reference to the employment of negroes as soldiers.
I think the measure not only expedient but necessary. The enemy will
certainly use them against us if he can get possession of them, and as
his present numerical superiority will enable him to penetrate many
parts of the country, I can not see the wisdom of the policy of holding
them to await his arrival, when we may, by timely action and judicious
management, use them to arrest his progress. I do not think that our
white population can supply the necessities of a long war without over¬
taxing its capacity, and imposing great suffering upon our people; and
I believe we should provide resources for a protracted struggle, not
merely for a battle or a campaign.
"In answer to your second question I can only say that, in my
opinion, under proper circumstances the negroes will make efficient sol¬
diers. I think we could at least do as well with them as the enemy, and
he attaches great importance to their assistance. Under good officers
and good instructions I do not see why they should not become soldiers.
They possess all the physical qualifications, and their habits of obedi¬
ence constitute a good formulation for discipline. They furnish a more
promising material than many armies of which we read in history,
Vhich owed their efficiency to discipline alone. I think those employed
