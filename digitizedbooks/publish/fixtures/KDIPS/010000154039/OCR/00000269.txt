spring to his feet and in line for battle, for none knew the moment the
enemy, like a tiger, woufd pounce upon them. It was a night of intense
anxiety, shrouded in mystery as to what to-morrow would bring. The
white and black soldier in one common bed lay in battle panoply, dream¬
ing their common dreams of home and loved ones.
" Here lay the heroic 54th picturing to themselves the memorable
nights of July 17 and 18, their bivouac on the beach and their capture
of Fort Wagner and the terrible fate of their comrades. They were all
veteran troops save the 8th Pennsylvania, which upon many hard-
fought fields had covered themselves with gallant honor in defense of
their country's cause, from Malvern Hill to Morris Island.
It was in the gray of the next morning that Gen. Seymour's order
aroused the command. The men partook of a hastily prepared cup of
coffee and meat and hard-tack from their haversacks. At sunrise the
troops took up the line of march, following the railroad for Lake City.
Col. Henry, with the 40th Massachusetts Mounted Infantry and Major
Stevens' independent battalion of Massachusetts cavalry, led the col¬
umn. About half-past one o'clock they reached a point where the country
road crossed the railroad, about two miles east of Olustee, and six miles
west of Sanderson, a station through which the troops passed about
half-bast eleven o'clock. As the head of the column reached the crossing
the rebel pickets fired and fell back upon a line of skirmishers, pursued
by Col. Henry's command. The enemy's main force was supposed to be
some miles distant from this place, consequently General Seymour had
not taken the precaution to protect his flanks, though marching through
an enemy's country. Consequently he found his troops flanked on either
side.
"Col. Henry drove the skirmishers back upon their main forces,
which were strongly posted between two swamps. The position was ad¬
mirably chosen; their right rested upon a low, slight earthwork, protec¬
ted by rifle-pits, their center was defended by an impassable swamp, and
on their left was a cavalry force drawn up on a small elevation behind
the shelter of a grove of pines. Their camp was intersected by the rail¬
road, on which was placed a battery capable of operating against the
center and left of the advancing column, while a rifie gun, mounted on a
railroad flat, pointed down the road in front.
" Gen. Seymour, in order to attack this strongly fortified position,
had necessarily to place his troops between the two swamps, one in his
front, the other in the rear. The Federal cavalry, following up the skir¬
mishers, had attacked the rebel right and were driven back, but were met
by the 7th New Hampshire, 7th Connecticut., a regiment of the black
Phalanx (8th Pennsylvania), and Elder's battery of four and Hamilton's
of six pieces. This force was hurled against the rebel right with such im¬
petuosity that the batteries were within one hundred yards of the rebel
line of battle before they knew it. However, they took position, and
supported by the Phalanx regiment, opened a vigorous fire upon the
rebel earthworks. The Phalanx regiment advanced within twenty or
