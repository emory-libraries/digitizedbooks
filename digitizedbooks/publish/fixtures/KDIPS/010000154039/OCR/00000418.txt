416 History of the Black Phalanx.
ken clay, and the masses of rubbish that were everywhere about. Many
of the enemy's men were lying among the.ruins, half buried, and vainly
trying to free themselves. They called for mercy and for help. The-
soldiers stopped to take prisoners, to dig out guns and other material.
Their division commander was not with them, there was no responsible
head, the ranks were broken, the regimental organizations could not be
preserved, and the troops were becoming confused. The enemy was
recovering from his surprise, our artillery began to receive a spirited
response, the enemy's men went back to their guns; they gathered on
the crest and soon brought to bear upon our troops a fire in front from
the Cemetery Hill, and an enfilading and cross-fire from their guns in
battery. Our own guns could not altogether silence or overcome this
fire in flank, our men in the crater were checked, felt the enemy's fire,
sought cover, began to entrench. The day was lost, still heroic men
continued to push forward for the crest, but in passing through the
crater few got beyond it. Regiment after regiment, brigade followed
brigade, until the three white divisions filled the opening and choked
the passage to all. What was a few moments ago organization and
order, was now a disordered mass of armed men. At six o'clock, Gen¬
eral Meade ordered General Burnside to push 'his men forward, at all
hazards, white and black.' His white troops were all in the crater, and
could not get out. As instructed, he ordered General Ferrero to rush in
the Phalanx; Colonel Loving was near when the order came to Ferrero;
as the senior staff officer present, seeing the impossibility of the troops
to get through the crater, at that time countermanded the order, and
reported in person to General Burnside, but he had no discretion to
exercise, his duty was simply to repeat Meade's order. The order must
be obeyed; it was repeated; away went the Phalanx division, loudly
cheering, but to what purpose did they advance? The historian of
that valiant corps, presumably more reliable than any other writer,
says:
"'The colored troops charged forward, cheering with enthusiasm
and gallantry. Colonel J. K. Sigfried, commanding the first brigade,
led the attacking column. The command moved out in rear of Colonel
Humphrey's brigade of the Third Division. Colonel Sigfried, passing
Colonel Humphrey by the flank, crossed the field immediately in front,
went down the crater, and attempted to go through. The passage was
exceedingly difficult, but after great exertions the brigade made its way
through the crowded masses in a somewhat broken and disorganized
condition, and advanced towards the crest. The 43rd U. S. Colored
troops moved over the lip of the crater toward the right, made an
attack upon the enemy's line of intrenchments, and won the chief suc¬
cess of the day, capturing a number of prisoners and rebel colors, and
re-capturing a stand of national colois. The other regiments of the
brigade were unable to get up, on account of white troops in advance
of them crowding the line. The second brigade, under command of
Colonel H. G. Thomas, followed the first with equal enthusiasm. Th»
