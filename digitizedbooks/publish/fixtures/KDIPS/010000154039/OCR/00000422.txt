History of the Black Phalanx.
With the exception of General Burnside, no com¬
mander of the Army of the Potomac was in favor of the
Phalanx participating in a battle. What, then, had the
Phalanx to expect of those to whom they had borne the
relation of slave? The confederates had a right to expect
haxd fighting when they met the Phalanx, and the Pha¬
lanx knew they had to fight hard when they met the
confederates. It was the previous associations and habits
of the negro that kept him from retaliating for the several
massacres that had been perpetrated upon his brother-
soldiers. It was not for a want of courage to do it:
it was only necessary for those who commanded them to
have ordered it, and they would never have taken a
confederate prisoner.
Many of those who commanded them needed but
public opinion to sustain them, to give such an order as
would have made every battle between the Phalanx and
the confederates bloody and inhuman. It was but the
enlightened sentiment of the North, the religious teaching
of the brotherhood of man, the high character and moral
draining of the statesmen on the side of the Union, that
restrained the Phalanx from retaliation, else they pos¬
sessed none of the characteristics of a courageous, sensi¬
tive and high tempered people. The negro is not naturally
docile; his surroundings, rather than his nature, have
given him the trait; it is not naturally his, but something
which his trainers have given him; and it is not a difficult
task to untrain him and advance him beyond his appar¬
ent unconsciousness of self-duty and self-preservation.
Let him feel that he is to be supported in any transaction
uncommon to him, and he can act as aggressively as any
race of men who are naturally quicker in temperament.
It is this characteristic that made the negro what General
Grant said he was: in discipline a better soldier than the
white man. It was said that he would not fight: there is
no man in the South who met him on the battle-field that
will say so now.
These are a lew of the thoughts that came to me as I
listened for an hour, one evening in June, 1883, to the
