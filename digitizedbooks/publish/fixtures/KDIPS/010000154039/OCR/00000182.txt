Histoky of the Black Phalanx.
the New York and Massachusetts regiments. While lying
on a battle-field wounded and exhausted, an officer of the
brigade to which the writer belonged, rode up, passed me
his canteen, and enquired if I knew him. A negative an¬
swer was given. " I am Tom Bunting," he replied. " You
know me now, don't you? We used to play together in
our boyhood days in Virginia; keep the canteen. I will let
your people know about you." So saying he dashed away
to his command; he belonged to a Massachusetts regi¬
ment. There was quite a large number of mulattoes who
enlisted under Butler, at New Orleans, and served in white
regiments; this is also true of the confederate army. The
writer has an intimate acquaintance now living in Rich¬
mond, Ya., who served in a New York Regiment, who,
while marching along with his regiment through Broad
street, after the capture of that city, was recognized by his
mother, and by her was pulled from the ranks and em¬
braced. A man who became United States Marshal of one
of the Southern States affcer the war, was Captain in the
2nd Louisiana Native Guards Regiment. Numerous in¬
stances of this kind could bd cited.
