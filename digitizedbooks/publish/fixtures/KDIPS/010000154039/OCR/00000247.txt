ordered all along the line, which was made, the enemy falling back slowly before our
troops, and finally retired from the field, leaving us in full possession, with a complete
victory.
" Only infantry was engaged on either fide except the rebel battery, which my regi¬
ment captured.
"Our cavalry, some five thousand strong, and artillery, about forty pieces, as already
stated, were on the North side of the river, and could not be brought into action, to
advantage, on account of the dense forest and swampy nature of the ground. We had
about fifteen thousand men engaged, while the enemy had the armies of Price and
Kirby Smith, from which our gallant commander, Steele, had for many days been flee¬
ing, as from the wrath to come. During the entire battle Steele remained on the north
aide of the river, beyond the reach of the enemy's guns, and at a point from which he
could continue his flight with safety in case of defeat. But the victory was ours, so
the march from Saline river to Little Rook was made in peace.
"During this battle my regiment lost in killed and wounded about eighty men, but
we were richly rewarded by the achievements of the day. We, perhaps, had as much to
do with bringing on the battle as any other one regiment. I went into action in the
morning without orders. In fact I disobeyed an order to cross the river at daylight,
and instead, I formed my regiment and faced the enemy. The regiment charged the
battery by my orders, and against an order from a superior officer, to hold back and
wait for orders.
" My regiment, though among the first in action, and having suffered a greater loss
than that of any other, was the last to leave the field.
" From this time forward until the close of the war, in so far as the Western army
was concerned, we heard no more of the question, 'Will they fight?'
" The reputation of at least one colored regiment was established, and it stands to¬
day, in the estimation of m&n who served in the Western army, as the equal of any
other volunteer regiment.
" After the Saline river battle the regiment moved back to Little Rock and thence
to Fort Smith, in western Arkansas.
"In July 18fi4, with the 2nd and other troops, I donducted an expedition through
the Choctaw Nation in the Indian Territory, against, or rather in pursuit of a brigade
of rebel forces, driving them out of that country. During this campaign several light
engagements were fought, in each of which the 2nd took a prominent part, and in each
of which the 2nd was invariably successful.
* "In the fall of 1864, I resigned my position as Colonel to assume other duties.
"What took place from then until the regiment was mustered out of service, I only
know from heresay, but it is safe to say that the regiment maintained its reputation as
one of the best infantry regiments in the 7th Army Corps.
"A short time before I left the regiment, General Marcy, then Inspector General of
the U. S. Army, inspected the Kansas Division, to which my regiment belonged, and his
report, which is now on file in the War Department, if I am not mistaken, shows that
the 2nd Colored in point of drill, discipline and military appearance, stood first of all
the regiments in that Division.

Lieutenant-Colonel Gilpatrick, promoted from Major,
took command of the regiment succeeding Colonel Craw¬
ford, and in December made a forced march to Hudson's
crossing on the Neosho river, by way of Fort Gibson, a
distance of one hundred and fifty miles, on quarter ra¬
tions, and returned as escort to a large supply train. It
was then, with all the Phalanx regiments at Fort Smith,
ordered to Little Rock, where it arrived with a very large
train of refugees under charge, on the 4th of February,
after a march of seventeen days.
Colonel Gilpatrick says:
" The men suffered severely on the march by exposure to wet and

nation for the office of Governor, and came from Fort Smith to Kansas, arriving about

Price and his army from the border of the State.
