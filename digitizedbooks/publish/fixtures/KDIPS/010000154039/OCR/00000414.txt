412 History of the Black Phalanx.
dated with the Army of the Potomac. They rejoiced at the prospect of
wiping off whatever reproach an ill-judged prejudice might have cast
upon them, by proving themselves brave, thereby demanding the re¬
spect which brave men deserve. For three weeks they drilled with alac¬
rity in the various movements; charging upon earthworks, wheeling by
the right and left, deployment, and other details of the expected opera¬
tions. General Burnside had early expressed his confidence in the sol¬
dierly capabilities of the men of the Phalanx, and now wished to give
them an opportunity to justify his good opinion."
His white troops, moreover, had been greatly exposed
throughout the whole campaign, had suffered severely,
and had been so much under the fire of the sharpshooters
that it had become a second nature with them to dodge
bullets. The negro troops had not been so much ex¬
posed, and had already shown their steadiness under fire
in one or two pretty severe skirmishes in which they had
previously been engaged. The white officers and men of
the corps were elated with the selection made by General
Burnside, and they, too, manifested an uncommon interest
in their dark-hued comrades. The demeanor of the former
toward the latter was very different from that of tlie
other corps, of which that particular army was compose^.
The 9th Corps had seen more service than any other corps
in the Army of the Potomac. Its operations in six States
had given to the men an experience calculated to destroy,
very greatly, their race prejudice; besides a very large
portion of the regiments in the corps came from the New
England States, especially Massachusetts, Vermont and
Rhode Island, where race prejudice was not so strong;
consequently the treatment of the men in the 4th Divis¬
ion was tempered by humanity, and pregnant with a fra¬
ternal feeling of comradeship. And then there was a corps
pride very naturally existing among the white troops,
which prompted a desire for the achievement of some
great and brilliant feat by their black comrades. This
feeling was expressed in more than one way by the entire
corps, and greatly enhanced the ambition of the Phalanx
to rout the-enemy and drive him out of his fortifications
before Petersburg, if not to capture the city.
These high hopes were soon dissipated, however. Gen-
