The Phalanx in Virginia.

"General Potter, in hia report, mentions that, when his division
occupied the front, his loss averaged some fourteen or fifteen officers
killed and wounded per diem. The sharpshooters on either side were
vigilant, and an exposure of any part of the person was the signal for
the exchange of shots. The men, worn by hard marching, hard fight¬
ing and hard digging, took every precaution to shield themselves, and
sought cover at every opportunity. They made fire proofs of logs and
earth, and with tortuous covered ways and traverse, endeavoring to
secure themselves from the enemy's fire. The artillery and mortars
on both sides were kept almost constantly at work. These were all
precursors of the coming, sanguinary struggle for the possession of
Cemetery Hill. Immediately in front of the salient occupied by the
Ninth Corps, the rebels had constructed a very strong redoubt, a
short distance below Cemetery Hill. In the rear of the redoubt ran
a ridge nearly at right angles with the rebels' lines, to the hill. It ap¬
peared that if this redoubt was captured, the enemy's line would be
seriously threatened, if not entirely broken up. A feasible plan for the
destruction of the redoubt, was seriously discussed among the soldiers
of the corps; finally Colonel Pleasants, of the 48th Pennsylvania Regi¬
ment, devised a plan to run a mine under the intervening space between
the line of the corps and the redoubt, with the design of exploding it,
directly under the redoubt. To this plan General Burnside lent his aid,
and preparations were made for an assault upon Cemetery Hill, at the
time of its explosion. The work of digging and preparing the mine was
prosecuted under the most disadvantageous circumstances. General
Meade reluctantly gave official sanction, and the work of excavation
proceeded with, despite the fact that General Burnside's requisitions for
supplies were not responded to. Nevertheless, in less than a month the
mine was ready, and after considerable discussion, and notf without
some bickering, the plan of attack was arranged, which, in brief, was
to form two columns, and to charge with them through the breach
caused by the explosion of the mine." Then to sweep along the enemy's
line, right and left, clearing away the artillery and infantry, by attack¬
ing in the flank and rear. Other columns were to make for the crest,
the whole to co-operate. General Ferrero, in command of the Phalanx
division was informed, that in accordance with the plan of attack, he
was to lead in the assault, when the attack was made, after the mine
had been fired. He was ordered to drill his troops accordingly. After
a careful examination of the ground, Ferrero decided upon his methods
of advance,—not to go directly in the crater formed by the explosion,
but rather upon one side of it, and then to take the enemy in flank and
reverse. "When he informed his officers and men that they would be
called upon to lead in the assault, they received the information with
delight. His men, desirous of emulating their comrades of the Third
Division of the Eighteenth Corps, felt that their cherished hope,—the
opportunity for which they had prayed,—was near at hand; the hour in
which they would show themselves worthy of the honor of being asso-
