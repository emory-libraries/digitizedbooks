this sable patriot credit for having been instrumental in
checking the British advance and saving the day.
At the unveiling of the statue erected to the memory
of Gen. Joseph Warren, who fell at Bunker Hill, the orator
of the occasion, Hon. Edward Everett, said:
"It is the monument of the day of the event, of the battle of Bunker
Hill; all of the brave men who shared its perils,—alike of Prescott and
Putnam and Warren, the chiefs of the day, and the colored man, Salem,
who, is reported to have shot the gallant Pitcairn, as he mounted the
parapet. Cold as the clods on which it rests, still as the silent Heaven to
which it soars, it is yet vocal, eloquent, in their individual praise."
The following is a copy of a petition now in the

" The subscribers beg leave to report to your Honorable House,
(which we do in justice to the character of so brave a man), that under
our own observation, we declare that a negro man named Salem Poor,
of Col. Frye's regiment, Capt. Ame's company, in the late battle at
Charleston, behaved like an experienced officer, as well as an excellent
soldier. To set forth particulars of his conduct would be tedious. We
only beg leave to say, in the person of this said negro, centers a brave
and gallant soldier. The reward due to so great and distinguished a
character, we submit to Congress.
