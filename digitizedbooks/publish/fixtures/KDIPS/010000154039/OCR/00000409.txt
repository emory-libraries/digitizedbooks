Division, 9th Corps), and was immediately ordered to
join its own proper corps,—from which it had been sepa¬
rated since the 6th of May,—at the crossing of the Rapi-
dan. It had served under Sedgwick and Sheridan until
the 17th, when it came under the direct command of
General Grant, and thus remained until the 25th of May,
when General Burnside, waiving rank to Meade, the 9th
Corps was incorporated into the Army of the Potomac.
During its absence the division sustained the reputable
renown of its corps, not only in protecting the trains, but
in fighting the enemy, and capturing prisoners. Before
rejoining the corps, the division was strengthened by
three regiments of cavalry,—the 5th New York, 3rd New
Jersey and 2nd Ohio. From the 9th of May till the 17th,
the division occupied the plank road, looking to the old
"Wilderness tavern, covering the extreme right of the
army, extending from Todd's to Banks' Ford. On the
17th, the division moved to Salem Church, near the main
road to Fredericksburg, where, as we have seen, it de¬
fended the rear line against the attack made by the con¬
federates, under General Ewell.
The historian of the corps says:
"The division on the 21st of May was covering Fredericksburg, and
the roads leading hence to Bowling Green. On the 22nd it marched
toward Bowling Green, and on the 23rd it moved to Milford Station.
From that date to the 27th it protected the trains of the army in the
rear of the positions on the North Anna. On the 27th, the division
moved to Newtown; on the 28th, to Dunkirk, crossing the Maltapony;
on the 29th, to tha Pamunkey, near Hanovertown. On the 1st of June
the troops crossed the Pamunkey, and from the 2nd to the 6th, covered
the right of the army; from the 6th to the 12th they covered the ap¬
proaches from New Castle Ferry, Hanovertown, Hawe's shop, and Be-
thusda Church. From the 12th to the 18th they moved by easy stages,
by way of Tunstall's New Kent Court House, Cole's Ferry, and the pon¬
toon bridge across the James, to the line of the army near Petersburg.
The dismounted cavalry were left to guard the trains, and the 4th Divis¬
ion prepared to participate in the more active work of soldiers.
Through the remainder of the month of June, and the most of July,
the troops were occupied in the second line of trenches, and in active
movements towards the left, under Generals Hancock and "Warren.
"While they were engaged in the trenches they were also drilled in the
movements necessary for an attack ancL occupation of the enemy's
