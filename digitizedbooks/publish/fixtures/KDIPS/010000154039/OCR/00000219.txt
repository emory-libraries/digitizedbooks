ors in his hands; the column seemed to melt away like
snow in sunshine, before the enemy's murderous fire; the
pride, the flower of the Phalanx, had fallen. Then, with
a daring that veterans only can exhibit, the blacks rushed
forward and up to the brink and base of the fortified ele¬
vation, with a shout that rose above it. The defenders
emptied their rifles, cannon and mortars upon the very
heads of the brave assaulters, making of them a human
hecatomb. Those who escaped found their way back to
shelter as best they could.
The battery was not captured; the battle was lost to
all except the black soldiers; they, with their terrible loss,
this diocese, then performed the Catholic service for the dead. After the regular ser¬
vices, he ascended to the president's chair, and delivered a glowing and eloquent eulogy
on the virtues of the deceased. He called upon all present to offer themselves, as Cal-
lioux had done, martyrs to the cause of justice, freedom, and good government. It was
a death the proudest might envy.
"Immense crowds of colored people had by this time gathered around the building,
and the streets leading thereto were rendered almost impassable. Two companies ot
the Sixth Louisiana (colored) Kegiment, from their camp on the Company Canal, were
there to act as an escort; and Esplanade Street, for more than a mile, was lined with
colored societies, both male and female, in open order, waiting for the hearse to pass
through.
"After a short pause, a sudden silence fell upon the crowd, the band commenced
playing a dirge; and the body was brought from the hall on the shoulders of eight sol¬
diers, escorted by six members of the society, and six colored captains, who acted as
pall-bearers. The corpse was conveyed to the hearse through a crowd composed of
both white and black people, and in silence profound as death itself. Not a sound was
heard save the mournful music of the band, and not a head in all that vast multitude
but was uncovered.
"The procession then moved off in the following order: The hearse containing the
body, with Capts. J. "W. Kinggold, "W. B. Barrett, S. J. Wilkinson, Eugene Mailleur, J.
A Glea, and A. St. Leger, (all of whom, we believe, belong to the Second Louisiana Na¬
tive Guards), and six members of The Friends of the Order, as pall-bearers; about a
hundred convalescent sick and wounded colored soldiers; the two companies of the
Sixth Regiment; a large number of colored officers of all native guard regiments; the
carriages containing Capt. Callioux's family, and a number of army officers; followed
by a large number of private individuals, and thirty-seven civic and religious societies.
" After moving through the principal down-town streets, the body was taken to
the Beinville-street cemetery, and there interred with military honors due his rank." * •
The following lines were penned at the time:
ANDRE CAILLOUX.
He lay just where he fell, A flag oftruce couldn't save,,
Soddening in a fervid summer's sun, No, n°r humam^could not give ^
Guarded by an enemy's hissing shell, This sable warrior a hallowed grave.
Rotting beneath the sound of rebels' gun Nor army of the Gult retrieve.
Fort.v consecutive davs Forty consecutive days.
In sijht of his own tent', His lifeless body pierced and rent,
And the remnant of his regiment. Leading m assault the black regiment.
He lay just where he fell, Jut there came days at length,
Nearest the rebel's redoubt and trench, TV hen Hudson felt their blast,
Under the verv Are of hell, hough less a thousand m strength,
A volunteer in a country's defence, or " our leader " vowed the last;
Forty consecutive days, orty consecutive days
And not a murmur of discontent, They Btormed, they charged, God sent
Went from the loyal black regiment. Victory to the loyal black regiment.
He lay just where he fell,
And now the ground was their's,
Around his mellowed corpse, heavens tell,
How his comrades for freedom swears.
Forty consecutive nights
The advance pass-word went,
Captain Cailloux of the black regiment.
