colored service, I was ordered before the Board of Examiners at Nash¬
ville, Tennessee, where I spent five rather anxious hours. "When I en¬
tered the army I knew absolutely nothing of the details of army life; had
never even drilled with a fire company. During the first three months I
gathered little except a somewhat rough miscellaneous experience. As a
lieutenant and staff officer I learned something, but as I had never had
at any time systematic instruction from any one, I appeared before the
Board with little else than vigorous health, a college education, a little
experience as a soldier, a good reputation as an officer, a fair amount of
common sense and a good supply of zeal. The Board averaged me, and
recommended me for a Major.
"A few days after the examination, I received an order to report to
Major George L. Stearns, who had charge of the organization of colored
troops in that Department. He assigned me to duty temporarily in a
camp in Nashville. Major Stearns was a merchant in Boston, who had
been for years an ardent abolitionist, and who, among other good deeds,
had befriended John Brown. He was a large-hearted, broad-minded
genial gentleman. When the policy of organizing colored troops was
adopted, he offered his services to the Government, received an appoint¬
ment as Assistant Adjutant General, and was ordered to Nashville to or¬
ganize colored regiments. He acted directly under the Secretary of "War,
and independently of the Department Commander. To his zeal, good
judgment and efficient labor, was due, very largely, the success of the
work in the "West.
"November 1st, 1863, by order of Major Stearns, I went to Galla¬
tin, Tennessee, to organize the 14th United States Colored Infantry.
General E. A. Paine was then in command of the post at Gallatin, hav¬
ing under him a small detachment of white troops. There were at that
time several hundred negro men in camp, in charge of, I think, a lieuten¬
ant. They were a motley crowd,—old, young, middle aged. Some wore
the United States uniform, but most of them had on the clothes in which
they had left the plantations, or had worn during periods of hard service
as laborers in the army. Gallatin at that time was threatened with an
attack by the guerilla bands then prowling over that part of the State.
General Paine had issued a hundred old muskets and rifles to the negroes
in camp. They had not passed a medical examination, had no company
organization and had had no drill. ^Almost immediately upon my arri¬
val, as an attack was imminent, I was ordered to distribute another
hundred muskets, and to 'prepare every available man for fight.' I
did the best I could under the circumstances, but am free to say that I
regard it as a fortunate circumstance that we had no fighting to do at
that time. But the men raw, and, untutored as they were, did guard
and picket duty, went foraging, guarded wagon trains, scouted after
guerillas, and so learned to soldier—by soldiering.
"As soon and as fast as practicable, I set about organizing the regi¬
ment. I was a complete novice in that kind of work, and all the young
officers who reported to me for duty, had been promoted from the ranks
