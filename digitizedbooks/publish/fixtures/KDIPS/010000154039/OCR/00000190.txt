Histoky of the Black Phalanx.
Bcale of civilization and prepared for freedom. Fifty regiments might b* raised amongf
them at once, which could be employed in this climate to preserve order, and thus pre¬
vent the necessity of retrenching our liberties, as we should do by a large army exclu¬
sively of whites. For it is evident that a considerable army of whites would give strin¬
gency to our government, while an army, partly of blacks, would naturally operate m
favor of freedom and against those influences which at present most endanger our lib¬
erties. At the end of live years they could be sent to Africa, and their places tilled with,
new enlistments. . . ....
"There is no practical evidence against the effects of immediate abolition, even it
there is not in its favor. I have witnessed the sudden abolition of flogging at will in
the army, and of legalized flogging in the navy, against the prejudice-warped judg¬
ments of both, and, from the beneficial effects there, I have nothing to fear from the im¬
mediate abolition of slavery. I fear, rather, the violent consequences from a continu¬
ance of the evil. But should such an act devastate the whole State of Louisiana, and
render the whole soil here but the mere passage-way of the fruits of the enterprise and
industry of the Northwest, it would be better for the country at large than it is now a®
the seat of disaffection and rebellion.
"When it is remembered that not a word is found in our constitution sanctioning-
the buying and selling of human beings, a shameless act which renders our country the
disgrace of Christendom, and worse, in this respect, even than Africa herself, we should*
have less dread of seeing the degrading traffic stopped at once and forever. Halt
wages are already virtually paid for slave labor in the system of tasks which, in an un¬
willing spirit of compromise, most of the slave states have already been compelled to»
adopt. At the end of five years of apprenticeship, or of fifteen at farthest, full wages
could be paid to the enfranchised negro race, to the double advantage of both master
and man. This is just; for we now hold the slaves of Louisiana by the same tenure-
that the State can alone claim them, viz: by the original right of conquest. We have-
so far conquered them that a proclmation setting them free, coupled with offers of pro¬
tection, would devastate every plantation in the State.
" In conclusion, I may state that Mr. La Blanche is, as I am informed, a descendant
from one of the oldest families of Louisiana. He is wealthy and a man of standing,
and his act in sending away his negroes to our lines, with their clothes and furniture,
appears to indicate the convictions of his own mind as to the proper logical conse¬
quences and deductions that should follow from the present relative status of the two
contending parties. He seems to be convinced that the proper result of the conflict is-
the manumission of the slave, and he may be safely regarded in this respect as a repre¬
sentative man of the State. I so regard him myself, and thus do I interpret his actton,
although my camp now contains some of the highest symbols of secessionisin, which
have been taken by a party of the Seventh Vermont volunteers from his residence.
"Meantime his slaves, old and young, little ones and all, are suffering from expos¬
ure and uncertainty as to their future condition. Driven away by their master, with<
threats of violence if they return, and with no decided welcome or reception from us,
what is to be their lot? Considera.tions of humanity are pressing for an immediate so¬
lution of their difficulties; and they are but a small portion of their race who have
sought, and are still seeking, our pickets and our military stations, declaring that they
can not and will not any longer serve their masters, and that all they want is work and
protection from us. In such a state of things, the question occurs as to my own action
in the case. I cannot return them to their masters, who not unfrequently come in
search of them, for I am, fortunately, prohibited by an article of war from doing that,,
even if my own nature did not revolt at it. I can not receive them, for I have neither-
work, shelter, nor the means or plan of transporting them to Ha.yti, or of making suit¬
able arrangements with their masters until they can be provided for,
" It is evident that some plan, some policy, or some system is necessary on the part
of the government, without which the agent can do nothing, and all his efforts are gen¬
dered useless and of no effect. This is no new condition in which I find myself; it is my
experience during the some twenty-five years of my public life as a military officer of
the government. The new article of war recently adopted by congress, rendering it
criminal in an officer of the army to return fugitives from injustice, is the first support
that I have ever felt from the government in contending against those slave influences
which are opposed to its character and to its interests. But the mere refusal to return
fugitives does not now meet the case. A public agent in the present emergency must be-
invested with wider and more positive powers than this, or his services will prove as
valueless to the country as they are unsatisfactory to himself.
"Desiring this communication to be laid before the president, and leaving my com¬
mission at his disposal, I have the honor to remain, sir,
"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. W. Phelps, Brigadier-General."
On the day on which he received this letter, Gen. But¬
ler forwarded to Washington this dispatch:
, "New Orleans, La., June 18,1862.
"Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War:
" Sib :—Since my last dispatch was written, 1 have received the accompanying re¬
port from General Phelps.
" It is not my duty to enter into a discussion of the questions which it. presents.
" I desire, however, to state the information of Mr. La Blanche, given me by hia
friends and neighbors, and also Jack La Blanche, his slave, who seems to be th»
leader of this party of negroes. Mr. La Blanche I have not seen. He, however,
claims to be loyal, and to have taken no part in the war, but to have lived quietly on
