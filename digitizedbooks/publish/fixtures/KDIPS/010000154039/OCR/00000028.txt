History of the Black Phalanx.
into an unrequited bondage, the fire of his courage,—
like that of other races similarly situated, without hope
of liberty; doomed to toil,—slackened into an apathetic
$tate, and seeming willing servitude, which produced a
resignation to fate from 1619 to 17T0, more thajn a cen¬
tury and a half. At the latter date, for the first time in
the .history of what is now the United States, the negro,
inspired wtith the • love of liberty, aimed a blow at the
authority that held him in bondage. In numerous in¬
stances, when the Indians attacked the white settlers,
particularly in the Northern colonies, negroes were sum¬

As early as 1652, the militia law of Massachusetts
required negroes, Scotchmen and Indians,—the indentured
slaves of Cromwell, who encountered his army at the bat¬

uncommon occurrence for them to be manumitted for
meritorious and courageous action in defending their
masters' families, often in the absence of the master, when
attacked by the red men of the woods. It was not infre¬

that of the white man; consequently they fought with a
desperation equal to that of the whites, against the com¬

of arms, that one of the first acts of the settlers after the
Indians were driven from the forest, was to disarm and
forbid negroes keeping or handling fire-arms and weap¬
ons of every sort. This was done from a sense of self-
preservation and fear that the negroes might (and
many did) attempt to revenge themselves when cruelly-
treated, or rise in mutiny and massacre the whites.
But it was not until 1770, when the fervor of rebellion
had influenced the people of the colonies, and Capt. Pres¬
ton, with the King's soldiers, appeared in King Street,
Boston, to enforce the decree of the British Parliament,
