130 History of the Black Phalanx.
The Washington authorities established recruiting
stations throughout the South. Of the difficulties under
which recruiting officers labored some idea may be formed
by reading the following, written by the historian of the
7th Eegiment:
"The position of recruiting officer for colored troops was by no
means a sinecure; on the contrary, it was attended with hardships,
annoyances and difficulties without number. Moving about from place
to place; often on scant rations, and always without transportation,
save what could be pressed into service; sleeping in barns, out-houses,
public buildings,—wherever shelter could be found, and meeting from the
people everywhere opposition and dislike. To have been an officer of
colored troops was of itself sufficient to ostracize, and when, in addition,
one had to take from them their slaves, dislike became absolute hatred.
There were, of course, exceptions, and doubtless every officer engaged on
this disagreeable duty can bear testimony to receiving at times a hospi¬
tality as generous as it was unexpected, even from people whom duty
compelled them to despoil. But this was always from " union men," for
it must be confessed that a large proportion of the property-holders on
both the eastern and western shores of the Chesapeake were as deeply in
sympathy with the rebellion as their brethren over the Virginia border.
" Perhaps the most disagreeable feature of this recruiting duty was
that jGen. Birney (Supt. of recruiting of negro troops in Maryland) sel¬
dom saw fit to give his subordinates anything but verbal instructions.
Officers were ordered to open recruiting stations; to raid through the
country, carrying off slaves from under the eyes of their masters; to
press horses for their own use and that of their men, and teams and
vehicles for purposes of transportation; to take forage when needed; to
occupy buildings and appropriate fuel; in short, to do a hundred things
they had really no legal right to do, and had they been called upon, as
was likely to happen at any time, for the authority under which •they
were acting, they would have had nothing to show but their commis¬
sions; and if, in carrying out these verbal instructions from their chief,
they had become involved in serious difficulty, they had little reason to
suppose that they would be sustained by him.
" When it is remembered that slavery was at that time still a recog¬
nized institution, and that the duty of a recruiting officer often required
him to literally strip a plantation of its field hands, and that, too, at a
time of the year when the crops were being gathered, it is perhaps to be
wondered that the bitter feelings of the slave-owners did not often find
vent in open resistence and actual violence. That this delicate and dis¬
agreeable duty was performed in a manner to avoid serious difficulty
certainly speaks well for the prudence and good judgment of the officers
and men engaged in it.
" The usual method of proceeding was, upon reaehing a designated
point, to occupy the most desirable public building, dwelling-house, ware-
