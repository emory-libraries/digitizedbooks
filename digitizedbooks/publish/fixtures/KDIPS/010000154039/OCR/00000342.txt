History of the Black Phalanx.
"than slow torture by starvation, to which I knew that so many of out*
soldiers had been subjected, and remembering that the Confederate Con¬
gress had declared officers of colored troops outlaws, I replied, as my
eyes met his, ' shoot if you dare.' Instead of carrying out his threat he
withdrew his aim and staggered on. Here Lieut. Ferguson lost his hat,
which had been already twice stolen and recovered. One of the rebs
came up behind him and taking the hat from his head replaced it with
his own and ran off. The lieutenant consoled himself with the reflection
that at last he had a hat no one would steal.
" 'At about 7 p. m. we arrived at Libby Prison and were separated
from the enlisted men, who, we afterward learned, suffered untold hard¬
ships, to which many of them succumbed. Some were claimed as slaves
by men who had never known them; others denied fuel and shelter
through the winter, and sometimes water with which to quench their
thirst; the sick and dying neglected or maltreated and even murdered
by incompetent and fiendish surgeons; without rations for days together;
shot at without the slightest reason or only to gratify the caprice of the
guards,—all of which harrowing details were fully corroborated by the
few emaciated wrecks that survived.
"' We were marched inside the prison, searched, and what money we
had taken from us. I was allowed to retain pocket-book, knife and
watch. Our names were recorded and we were told to follow the sergeant.
Now, I thought, the question will be decided whether we are to go up
stairs where we knew the officers were quartered, or be confined in the
cells below. As we neared the corner of the large room and I saw the
sergeant directing his steps to the stairs leading down, I thought it had
been better had we fallen on the battle-field. He led the way down to a
cell, and as we passed in barred and locked the door and left us in dark¬
ness. Here, without rations, the bare stone floor for a bed, the damp¬
ness trickling down the walls on either side, seven of us were confined in
a close room about seven feet by nine. It was a long night, but finally
morning dawned and as a ray of light shone through the little barred
window above our heads we thanked God we were not in total darkness.
About 9 a. m. rations, consisting of bread and meat, were handed in,
and being divided into seven parts, were drawn for by lot. About noon
we were taken from the cell and put in with the other officers. Here we
met Capt. Cook, of the Ninth Regiment, who had been captured about a
month previous while reconnoitering the enemy'§ line.
"'We were now in a large room, perhaps forty by ninety feet, with
large windows, entirely destitute of glass. No blankets nor anything to
sit or lie upon except the floor, and at night when we lay down the floor
was literally covered.
'"About the middle of the second night we were all hurriedly marched
out and packed in filthy box-cars—like sardines, for there was not room
for all to sit down—for an unknown destination. After a slow and
tedious ride we arrived at Salisbury, N. C. "When we arrived there were
but few prisoners, and for two or three days we received fair rations of
