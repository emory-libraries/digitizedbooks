the Phalanx, and the enemy was driven back before day¬
light, while the trains were securely m,oved up closer to
the advance. General Grant, finding that the confeder¬
ates were not disposed to continue the battle, began the
movement toward Spottsylvania Court House on the
night of the 7th. The 9th Corps brought up the rear,
with the Phalanx division and cavalry covering the
trains.
Butler and his Phalanx troops, as we have seen, was
within six miles of Petersburg, and on the 7th, Generals
Smith and Gillmore reached the railroad near Port Walt¬
hall Junction, and commenced destroying it; the confed¬
erates attacked them, but were repulsed. Col. West, on
the north side of the James River, forded the Chickahom-
iny with the Phalanx cavalry, and arrived opposite City
Point, having destroyed the railroad for some distance
on that side.
Leaving General Hinks with his Phalanx division to
hold City Point, on the 9th Butler again moved forward
to break up the railroad which the forces under Smith
and Gillmore succeeded in doing, thus separating Beaure-
guard's force from Lee's. He announced the result of his
operation's in the following message to Washington:
"May 9th, 1864.
" Our operations may be summed up in a few words. With one
thousand and seven hundred cavalry we have advanced up the Penin¬
sula, forced the Chickahominy and have safely brought them to our
present position. These were colored cavalry, and are now holding, our
advanced pickets toward Richmond. General Kautz, with three thou¬
sand cavalry from Suffolk, on the same day with our movement up
James river, forced the Blackwater, burned the railroad bridge at Stony
Creek, below Petersburg, cutting in two Beauregard's force at that
point. We have landed here, intrenched ourselves, destroyed many
miles of railroad, and got possession, which, with proper supplies, we
can hold out against the whole of Lee's army. I have ordered up the
supplies. Beauregard, with a large portion of his force, was left south,
by the cutting of the railroad by Kautz. That portion which reached
Petersburg under Hill, I have whipped to-day, killing and wounding
many, and taking many prisoners, after a well contested fight. General
Grant will not be troubled with any further re-inforcements to Lee from
Beaureguard's force. ' BENJ. F. BUTLER,
Major-General."
