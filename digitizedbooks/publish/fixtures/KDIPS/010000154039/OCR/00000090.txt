said, in a speech delivered on the 22nd January 1828, be¬

" Slaves or negroes who had been slaves were enlisted as soldiers in
the war of the Revolution: and I myself saw a battalion of them,—as
fine martial looking men as I ever saw attached to the Northern army in
th6 last war (1812),—on its march from Plattsburg to Sacket's Har¬
bor, where they did service for the country with credit to New York and
honor to themselves."
As in the dark days of the Revolution, so now in
another period of national danger, the negroes proved
their'courage and patriotism by service in the field. How¬
ever, the lamentable treatment of Major Jeffrey* is evi¬
dence that these services were not regarded as a protec¬
tion against outrage.

has been traced in these pages, there is nothing that miti¬
gates against his manhood, though his condition, either
bond or free, was lowly. But on the contrary the honor
of the race has been maintained under every circumstance
in which it has been placed.
