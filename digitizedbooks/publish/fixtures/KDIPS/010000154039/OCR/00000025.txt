The AVar of 1775.

North, of enlisting in the American army, a large force of
colored men would have been in the field, fighting for
America's independence. Of the services of the little band,
scattered as they were throughout the army, two or three
in a company composed of whites, a squad in a regiment,
a few companies with an army, made it quite impossible
for their record, beyond this, to be distinct from the organ¬
izations they were attached to. However, enough has been
culled from the history of that conflict, to show that they
bore a brave part in the struggle which wrested the colo¬
nies from the control of Great Britain, and won for them¬
selves and offspring, freedom, which many of them never
enjoyed. I have studiously avoided narrating the conduct
of those who cast their fortune with the British, save those
who went with Lord Dunmore, for reasons too obvious to
make mention of.
The sentiments of a majority of the people of the colo¬
nies were in full accord with the declaration opposing
slavery, and they sought to give it supremacy by their
success in the conflict. Slavery, which barred the entrance
to the army of the colored man at the South, had been
denounced by the colonist before the adoption of the arti¬
cles of confederation, and was maintained solely by local
regulations. As early as 1774, all the colonies had agreed
to, and their representatives to the congress had signed,
the articles of the Continental Association, by which it was
agreed, "that we will neither import nor purchase any slave
imported after the first day of December next, (1774), after
which we will wholly discontinue the slave trade, and will
neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our
vessels, nor sell our commodities or manufactories to those
who are concerned in it." Georgia not being represented
in this Congress, consequently was not in the Associa¬
tion, but as soon as her Provincial Congress assembled in
July, 1775, it passed the following resolutions:
"J.—Resolved, That this Congress will adopt and carry into execu¬
tion all and singular the measures and recommendations of the late Con¬
tinental Congress.
" IV.—Resolved, That we will neither import or purchase any slave
imported from Africa or elsewhere after this day, (July, 6.")
