History of the Black Phalanx.
CHAPTER Vni.
THE ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND.
Important services were rendered by the Phalanx in
the West. The operations in Missouri, Tennessee and
Kentucky, afforded an excellent opportunity to the com¬
manders of the Union forces to raise negro troops in such
portions of the territory as they held; but in consequence
of the bitterness against such action by the semi-Union¬
ists and Copperheads in the Department of the Ohio and
Cumberland, it was not until the fall of 1863 that the
organizing of such troops in these Departments fairly be¬
gan. The Mississippi was well-nigh guarded by Phalanx
regiments enlisted along that river, numbering about fifty
thousand men. They garrisoned the fortifications, and
occupied the captured towns. Later on, however, when the
confederate General Bragg began preparations for the re¬
covery of the Tennessee Yalley, organization of the Phalanx
commenced in earnest, and proceeded with a rapidity that
astounded even those who were favorable to the policy.
St. Louis became a depot and Benton Barracks a recruit¬
ing station, from whence, in the fall of 1863, went many a
regiment of brave black men, whose chivalrous deeds will
ever live in the annals of the nation. It was not long
after this time that the noble Army of the Cumberland be¬
gan to receive a portion of the black troops, whose shouts
rang through the mountain fastnesses. The record made
by the 60th Regiment is the boast of the State of Iowa,
to which it was accredited: but of those which went to the
assistance of General Thomas' army none won greater
distinction and honor than the gallant brigade com-
