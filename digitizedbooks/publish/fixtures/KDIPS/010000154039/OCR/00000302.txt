History of the JBlack Phalanx.
asked him if lie was frightened? His reply was, 'Fore God, Captain, I
thought I was a dead man, sure!'
" Friday, Oct. 28th, 1864, at twelve o'clock, at the head of 355 men,
in obedience to orders from General Granger, I charged and took a bat¬
tery, with a loss of sixty officers and men killed and wounded. After
capturing the battery, and spiking the guns, which we were unable to re¬
move, we retired to our former place in the line of defense. The conduct
of the men on this occasion was most admirable, and drew forth high
praise from Generals Granger and Thomas.
"Hood, having decided to push on to Nashville without assaulting
Decatur, withdrew. As soon as I missed his troops from my front, I no¬
tified the General commanding, and was ordered to pursue, with the
view of finding where he was. About ten o'clock the next morning, my
skirmishers came up with his rear guard, which opened upon us a brisk
infantry fire. Lieutenant "Woodworth, standing at my side, fell dead,
pierced through the face. General Granger ordered me to retire in¬
side of the works, and the regiment, although exposed to a sharp fire,
ciame off in splendid order. As y/e marched inside the works, the white
soldiers, who had watched the manoeuvre, gave us three rousing cheers.
I have heard the Pope's famous choir at St. Peters, and the great organ
at Freibourg, but the music was not so sweet as the hearty plaudits of
our brave comrades.
"As indicating the change in public sentiment relative to colored
soldiers, it may be mentioned that the Lieutenant-Colonel commanding
the 68th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, requested me as a personal favor
to ask for the assignment of his regiment to my command, giving as a
reason that his men would rather fight along side of the 14th Colored
than with any white regiment. He was ordered to report to me.
"After Hood had gone, and after our journey of 244 miles, we re¬
turned to Chattanooga, but not to remain.
"Nashville, Tenn.—November 29,1864, in command of the 14th,
16th and 44th Regiments IT. S. C. I., I embarked on a railroad train at
Chattanooga for Nashville. On December 1st, with the 16th and most
of the 14th, I reached my destination, and was assigned to a place on
the extreme left of General Thomas' army then concentrating for the de¬
fence of Nashville against Hood's threatened attack.
"The train that contained the 44th colored regiment, and two com¬
panies of the 14th, under command of Colonel Johnson, was delayed
near Murfreesboro until Dec. 2nd, when it started for Nashville. But
when crossing a bridge not far from the city, its progress was suddenly
checked by a cross-fire of cannon belonging to Forest's command. I had
become very anxious over the delay in the arrival of these troops, and
when I heard the roar of cannon thought it must be aimed at them. I
never shall forget the intensity of my suffering, as hour after hour
passed by bringing me no tidings. Were they all captured? Had they
been massacred? "Who could answer? No one. What was to be done?
Nothing. I could only wait and suffer.
