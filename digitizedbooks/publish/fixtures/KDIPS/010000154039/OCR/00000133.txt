Recruiting and Organizing.

house, or barn found vacant, and with this as a rendezvous, small
parties were sent into the surrounding country, visiting each plantation
within a raidus of twenty or thirty miles. The parties, sometimes under
charge of an officer, usually consisted of a non-commissioned officer
and ten or twelve men.
"In these journeys through the country the recruiting officer often met
with strange experiences. Recruits were taken wherever found, and as
their earthly possessions usually consisted of but what they "wore upon
their backs, they required no time to Settle their affairs. The laborer in
the field would throw down his hoe or quit his plow and march away
with the guard, leaving his late owner looking after him in speechless
amazement. On one occasion the writer met a planter on the road, fol¬
lowed by two of his slaves, each driving a loaded wagon. The usual
questions were asked and the whilom slaves joined the recruiting party,
leaving their teams and late master standing in the highway. At
another time a negro was met with a horse and wagon. Having ex¬
pressed his desire to "'list," he turned his horse's head toward home,
and marched away in the opposite direction.
" On one occasion the writer visited a large plantation near Capeville,
Va., and calling upon the proprietor asked him to call in his slaves.
He complied without a word, and when they caine and were asked if they
wished to enlist, replied that they did, and fell into the ranks with the
guard. As they started away the old man turned to me, and with tears
in his eyes, said, "Will you take them all? Here I am, an old man; I
cannot work; my crops are ungathered; my negroes have all enlisted or
run away, and what am I to do? A hard question, truly. Another
officer was called upon by a gentleman with this question, "You have
taken all my able-bodied men for soldiers, the others have run away,
and only the women and children are left;—what do you propose to do
with them ?" Another hard question.
"At another time, wThen the Balloon was lying at the mouth of the
Pocomoke, accompanied by Lieut. Brown and with a boat's crew, we
pulled up the river to the plantation of a Mrs. D., a noted rebel sympa¬
thizer. "We were met, as we expected, with the most violent abuse from
the fair proprietoress, which was redoubled when three of her best slaves,
each of whom had probably been worth a couple of thousand dollars in
ante-bellum days, took their bundles and marched off to the boat. We
bade the lady farewell, and pushed off amid the shouts and screams of a
score of negro women and children, and the tears and execrations of the
widow. ^ _ .
"To illustrate the unreasonable orders Gen. Birney was sometimes m
the habit of giving to officers engaged under him on recruiting service,
the writer well remembers being placed by him, at Pungoteague, Ya., in
charge of some 200 recruits he had forcibly taken from an officer recruit¬
ing under Col. Nelson's orders, and receiving from him (Gen. Birney) the
most positive orders under no circumstances to allow Col. Nelson to get
possession of them,—Col. Nelson's steamer was hourly expected—and
