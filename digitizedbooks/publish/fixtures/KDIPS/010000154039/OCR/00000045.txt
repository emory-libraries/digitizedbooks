The War of 1775.
43
Independence, no one will doubt, but that one section
was more willing than the other to sacrifice slavery for
freedom, I think is equally as plain. While the colonists
were debating with much anxiety the subject of what to
do with the negroes, the New England States were endeav¬
oring to draw the Southern States or Colonies into the
war by electing George Washington as Commander of the
army at Cambridge, and accepting the mis-interpretations
of the declarations of war. The Punic faith with which
the Southern States entered the war for liberty humiliated
the army, and wrung from its commander the letter writ¬
ten to Congress, and its approval of his course in re-enlist¬
ing free negroes. Meanwhile the British were actively
engaged in recruiting and organizing negroes into their
army and navy.
In November, 1775, Lord Dunmore visited Norfolk,
Virginia,* and, as Governor, finding his authority as such
not regarded by the whites, issued a proclamation offer¬
ing freedom to the slaves who would join the British army.
A fall description of the State of affairs at that time, is
thus given by an English historian:
"In letters which had been laid before the English Parliament, and
published to the whole world, he (Lord Dunmore) had represented the
planters as ambitious, selfish men, pursuing their own interest and
advancement at the expense of their poorer countrymen, and as being
ready to make every sacrifice of honesty and principle, and he had said
more privately, that, since they were so anxious for liberty,—for more
freedom than was consistent with the free institutions of the Mother
Country and the charter of the Colony,—that since they were so eager to
abolish a fanciful slavery in a dependence on Great Britain, he would try
how they liked abolition of real slavery, by setting free all their negroes
and indentured servants, who were, in fact, littl^better than white slaves.
This to the Virginians was like passing a rasp over a gangrened place; it
was probing a wound that was incurable, or one which had not yet been
healed. Later in the year, when the battle of Bunker's Hill had been
* Dunmore after destroying Norfolk, sailed with his fleet of men-of-war and more
than fifty transports, on board of which were many armed nejrroes and Koyal troops,
to the mouth of the Piankatank river, and took possession of Gwynn's Island, where
he landed his troops and entrenched. Here he was attacked by Gen. Lewis' men from
the opposite shdre. One of Dunmore's ships was badly damaged by cannon balls, and
he drew off and sailed up the Potomoc river, and occupied St. Georgia's Island, after
having burned a mansion at the mouth of Aqua Creek. He was here attacked by a
militia force and retired. Misfortune followed him; disease, shipwreck and want of
provisions. He soon made sail, and with his negroes reached England, where he
remained.
