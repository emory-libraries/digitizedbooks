The War of 1812.
87
Perhaps the most glowing account of the services of
these black American soldiers, appeared in an article in
the New Orleans Picayune:
"Not the least interesting, although the most novel feature of the
procession yesterday, was the presence of ninety of the colored veterans
who bore a conspicuous part in the dangers of the day they were now
for the first time called to assist in celebrating, and who, by their good
conduct in presence of the enemy, deserved and received the appro¬
bation of their illustrious commander-in-chief. During the thirty-six
years that have passed away since they assisted to repel the invaders
from our shores, these faithful men have never before participated in the
annual rejoicings for the victory which their valor contributed to gain.
Their good deeds have been consecrated only in their memories, or lived
but to claim a passing notice on the page of the historian. Yet, who
more than they deserve the thanks of the country, and the gratitude of
succeeding generations ? Who rallied with more alacrity in response to
the summons of danger? Who endured more cheerfully the hardships
of the camp, or faced with greater courage the perils of the fight? If,
in that hazardous hour, when our homes were menanced with the hor¬
rors of war, we did not disdain to call upon the colored population to
assist in repelling the invading horde, we should not, when the danger is
passed, refuse to permit them to unite with us in celebrating the glori¬
ous event, which they helped to make so memorable an epoch in our his¬
tory. We were not too exalted to mingle with them in the affray; they
were not too humble to join in our rejoicings.
"Such, we think, is the universal opinion of our citizens. We con¬
versed with many yesterday, and, without exception, they expressed
approval of the invitation which had been extended to the colored vet¬
erans to take part in the ceremonies of the day, and gratification at
seeing them in a conspicuous place in the procession.
"The respectability of their appearance, and the modesty of their
demeanor, made an impression on every observer, and elicited unquali¬
fied approbation. Indeed, though in saying so we do not mean disre¬
spect to any one else, we think that they constituted decidedly the most
interesting portion of the pageant, as they certainly attracted the most
attention."
It was during the rebellion of 1861-65 that the author
saw one of the colored drummer boys of that column
beating his drum at the head of a negro United States
regiment marching through the streets of New Orleans in
1862.
The New York battalion was organized and marched
to the reinforcement of the American army at Sacket's
