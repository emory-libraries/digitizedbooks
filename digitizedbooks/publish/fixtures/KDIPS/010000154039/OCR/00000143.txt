By command of Major General B. F. Butler:

The chief result of Butler's order was the establish¬
ment of the Freedmens' Savings Bank. At the close of
the war, there were in the hahds of the Superintendent of
Negro Affairs, eight thousand dollars unclaimed bounties,
belonging, the most of it without doubt, to dead men; it
was placed in a bank at Norfolk, Va. This sum served as
a nucleus for the Freedmens' Bank, which, after gathering
large sums of the Freedmens' money, collapsed suddenly.
At Camp Hamilton several regiments were organized,
including two of cavalry. The general enlistment ordered
by the "War Department was pushed most actively and
with great results, till more than one hundred and sev¬
enty-eight thousand, by the records, were enlisted into the
army.
The opposition to negro soldiers did not cease with
many of the Union generals even after the Government at
"Washington issued its mandate for their enlistment
and impressment, and notwithstanding that the many
thousands in the service, with their display of gallantry,
dash and courage, as exhibited at Port Hudson, Mil-
liken's Bend, Wagner, and in a hundred other battles,
had astonished and aroused the civilized world. In
view of all this, and, even more strangely, in the face of
the Fort Pillow butchery, General Sherman wrote to the
"Washington authorities, in September, 1864, protesting
against negro troops being organized in his department.
If Whitelaw Beid's "Ohio in the "War," is to be relied
upon, Sherman's treatment of the negroes in his march to
the sea was a counterpart of the Fort Pillow massacre.
His opposition was in keeping with that of the authorities
of his state,* notwithstanding it has credited to its quota
* "It has been said that one negro regiment was raised In 1863. More ought to
have been secured; let it never be said that It was the fault of the colored men them*
