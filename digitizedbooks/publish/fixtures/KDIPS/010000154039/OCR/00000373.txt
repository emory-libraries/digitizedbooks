The Black Flag.

supply tram, Lieut.-Colonel Hess was directed to place in position in a
wood the first regiment of colored, troops I could find. This was done,
and it is due to those troops to say here that they stood their ground
well and rendered valuable aid to Colonel McMillen, who was soon after
compelled to withdraw from ttfs original line and take up new positions
in rear. It was now 5 o'clock p. m. For seven hours, these gallant
officers and men had held their ground against overwhelming numbers,
but at last overpowered and exhausted they were compelled to abandon
not only the field, but many of their gallant comrades who had fallen
to the mercy of the enemy Everywhere the army now drifted toward
the rear and was soon altogether beyond control. I requested General
Grierson to accompany me and to aid in checking the fleeing column
and establishing a new line. By dint of entreaty and force and the aid
of several officers, whom I called to my assistance, with pistols in their
hands we at length succeeded in checking some 1200 or 1500 and estab¬
lishing them in a line, of which Colonel Wilkins, 9th Minnesota, was
placed in command. About this time it was reported to me that Col
McMillen was driving the enemy. I placed but little faith in this report,
yet disseminated it freely for the good effect it might produce upon the
troops. In a few minutes, however, the gallant Colonel McMillen, sad
and disheartened, arrived himself, and reported his lines broken and in
confusion. The new line under Colonel Wilkins also gave way soon after
and it was now impossible to exercise any further control. The road
became crowded and jammed with troops; the wagons and artillery
sinking into the deep mud became inextricable and added to the general
confusion which now prevailed. No power could now check or control
the panic-stricken mass as it swept toward the rear, led off by Colonel
Winslow at the head of his brigade of cavalry, and who never halted
until he had reached Stubbs', ten miles in rear. This was the greater
pity as his brigade was nearly, if not entirely, intact, and might have
offered considerable resistance to the advancing foe. About 10 o'clock
p. m., I reached Stubbs' in person, where I found Colonel Winslow and
his brigade. I then informed him that his was the only organized body
of men I had been able to find, and directed him to add to his own
every possible force he could rally, as they passed, and take charge of
the rear, remaining in position until all should have passed. I also in¬
formed him that on account of the extreme darkness of the night and
the wretched condition of the road, I had little hope of saving any¬
thing more than the troops, and directed him therefore to destroy all
wagons and artillery which he might find blocking up the road and pre¬
venting the passage of the men. In this way about 200 wagons and 14
pieces of artillery were lost, many of the wagons being burned and the
artillery spiked and otherwise mutilated; the mules and horses were
brought away. By 7 oclock a. m., of the 11th, we had reorganized at
Kipley, and the army presented quite a respectable appearance, and
would have been able to accomplish an orderly retreat from that point
but for the unfortunate circumstances that the cartridge boxes were well
