History of the Black Phalanx.
lot only the sternest, but the quickest, of all teachers; and contrasting
the Then and Now of our negro regiments, as we propose to do in this
sketch, the contrast will forcibly recall Galileo's obdurate assertion that
the world still moves.'
"Be it known, then, that the first regiment of. black troops raised in
)ur recent war, was raised in the Spring of 1862 by the commanding
general of the department of the South, of his own motion, and without
iny direct authority of law, order, or even sanction from the President,
the Secretary of War, or our House of Congress. It was done by Gen-
;ral Hunter as ' a military necessity' under very peculiar circumstances>
to be detailed hereafter; and although repudiated at first by the Govern-
nent as were so many other measures originated in the same quarter, it
vas finally adopted as the settled policy of the country and of our mili¬
tary system; as have likewise since been adopted, all the other original
neasures for which these officers, at the time of their first announce-
nent, was made to suffer both official rebuke and the violently vitupera¬
tive denunciation of more than one-half the Northern press.
"In the Spring of 1862, General Hunter, finding himself with less
than eleven thousand men under his command, and charged with the
luty of holding the whole tortuous and broken seacoast of Georgia,
South Carolina and Florida, had applied often, and in vain, to the au¬
thorities at Washington for reinforcements. All the troops that could
:>e gathered in the North were less than sufficient for the continuous
Irain of General McClellan's great operations against the enemy's capi¬
tal; and the reiterated answer of the War Department was: 'You must
?et along as best you can. Not a man from the North can be spared.'
"On the mainland of three States nominally forming the Department
of the South, the flag of the Union had no permanent foothold, save at
Fernandina, St. Augustine, and some few unimportant points along the
Florida coast. It was on the Sea-islands of Georgia and South Carolina
bhat our troops were stationed, and continually engaged in fortifying,—
bhe enemy being everywhere visible, and in, force, across the narrow
ireeks dividing us from the mainland; and in various raids they came
across to our islands, and we drove them back to the mainland, and up
bheir creeks, with a few gunboats to help us—being the order of the day;
yea, and yet oftener, of the night.
"No reinforcements to be had from the North; vast fatigue duties in
throwing up earthworks imposed on our insufficient garrison; the enemy
continually increasing both in insolence and numbers; our only success
the capture of Fort Pulaski, sealing up of Savannah; and this victory
offset, if not folly counter-balanced, by many minor gains of the enemy;
this was about the condition of affairs as seen from the headquarters
fronting Port Eoyal bay, when General Hunter one fine morning, with
twirling glasses, puckered lips, and dilated nostrils, (he had just received
another 'don't-bother-us-for-reinforcements' dispatch from Washington)
announced his intention of 'forming a negro regiment, and compelling
