594 History of the Black Phalanx.
;lamor and assertions of those journals, that the "nig¬
gers won't fight!"
Many papers favorable to the Emancipation, opposed
putting negro troops in battle in Virginia. But to all
these bomb-proof opinions Grant turned a deaf ear, and
when and where necessity required it, he hurled his Pha¬
lanx brigades against the enemy as readily as he did the
white troops. The conduct of the former was, neverthe¬
less, watched eagerly by the correspondents of the press
who were with the army, and when they began to chroni¬
cle the achievements of the Phalanx, the prejudice began
to give way, and praises were substituted in the place of
their well-worn denunciations. A correspondent of the
New York Herald thus wrote in May:
" The conduct of the colored troops, by the way, in the actions of
the last few days, is described as superb, An Ohio soldier said to me to¬

within reach of the enemy struck about them with a pitiless vigor,
that was almost fearful.' Another soldier said to me, ' These negroes
never shrink, nor hold back, no matter what the order. Through
scorching heat and pelting storms, if the order comes, they march with
prompt, ready feet.' Such praise is great praise, and it is deserved.

occupation of Fredericksburg, pointed out the prominent secessionists,
who were at once seized by our cavalry and put in safe quarters. In a
talk with a group of faithful fellows, I discovered in them all a perfect
understanding of the issues of the conflict, and a grand determination
to prove themselves worthy of the place and privileges to which they
are to be exalted."
The ice was thus broken, and then each war corres¬
pondent found it his duty to write in deservedly glowing
terms of the Phalanx.
The newspaper reports of the engagements stirred the
blood of the Englishman, and he eschewed his professed
love for the freedom of mankind, and particularly that of
the American negro. The London Times, in the following
article, lashed the North for arming the negroes to
shoot the confederates, forgetting, perhaps, that England
em ployed negroes against the colonist in 1775, and at New
Orleans, in 1814, had her black regiments to shoot down
