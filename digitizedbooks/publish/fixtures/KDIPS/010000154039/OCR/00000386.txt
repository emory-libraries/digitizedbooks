Massa Linkun! Three cheers for the President!" They
swung their caps, clapped their hands and shouted their
joy. Long, loud and jubilant were the rejoicings of these
redeemed sons of Africa. Regiment after regiment of
stalwart men,—slaves once, but freemen now,-with steady
step and even ranks, passed down the street, moving on
to the Old Dominion. It was the first review of the
negro troops by the President. Mr. Lincoln himself

Jr., and Ulysses Doubleday, and constituted the 3rd divis¬

Birney.
The Srd division of the 18th Corps, commanded by
