"Average percentage of sick in Artillery, 6.2; ditto, in Engineers,
11.9; ditto, in Black Infantry, 13.9; ditto, in "White Infantry, (exclud¬
ing one brigade), 20.1.
" This brigade consisted of the Ninety-seventh Pennsylvania, Twen¬
ty-fourth Massachusetts and Tenth Connecticut Volunteers. It averaged
thirty per cent sick. This was due to the fact that these three regiments
had been stationed, before moving to Morris Island, on Seabrook Is¬
land, which proved very unhealthy. The engineers and black infantry
■were employed exclusively on fatigue duty. The white infantry served
as guard of the trenches, as well as for work in the same.
"Details from the troops on Folly Island took part in the operations
on Morris Island.
"It was found by experience that men under these circumstances
could not work more than one-fourth the time. A greater amount at
once increased the sick list. Eight hours in thirty-two, or eight hours
on and twenty-four off, was found to be the best arrangement, as it made
a daily change in the hours of duty for those regiments permanently de¬
tailed for work.
"The organization found most advantageous in working a com¬
mand permanently detailed for fatigue duty, was to divide its effective
force into four equal detachments, on duty eight hours each, relieving
each other at 4 a. m., 12 m. and 8 p. m. The large number of extra
troops employed in the trenches each night were usually changed daily.
"The engineer officers in charge of the works were divided into cor.
responding groups, four in each, relieving each other at 8 a. m., 4 p. m.,
and 12 midnight, four hours' different from the time of relieving the
troops. This difference enabled the engineer officers to carry the work
through the period of relieving the fatigue details.
" One engineer officer, having from two to four different kinds or jobs
of work to superintend, was found to work advantageously in the night,
with the help of non-commissioned officers of engineers, from one hun¬
dred to two hundred men.
"The working parties of engineers and black infantry seldom carried
their arms into the trenches, while the white infantry fatigue parties
usually did."
