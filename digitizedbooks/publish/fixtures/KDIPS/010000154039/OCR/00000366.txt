History of the Black Phalanx.
" One man killed a rebel by striking him with the butt of his gun,
which he broke; but, being unwilling to stop his work, he loaded and
fired three times before he could get a better gun; the first time not being
cautious, the rebound of his gun badly cut his lip.
'' When the troops were in the ditch, three rebels came to one man,
and ordered him to surrendei. His gun being loaded, he shot one and
bayoneted another; and, forgetting he could bayonet the third,he turned
the biitt of his gun, and knocked him down.''
General Sturgis was severely criticised by the press im¬
mediately after the affair. Historians since the war have
followed up these criticisms. He has been accused of in¬
competency, rashness and drunkenness, none of which it is
the purpose of this volume to endorse. Possibly his re¬
ports furnish a sufficient explanation for the disaster,
which it is hoped they do, inasmuch as he is not charged
with either treason or cowardice.

"Headquarters United States Forces,
CoLiiiERSViLLE, Tenn., June 12,1864.
" General I have the honor to report that we met the enemy in
position and in heavy force about 10 a. m. on the 10th instant at Brice's
■Cross-Roads on the Ripley and Fulton road and about six miles north¬
west of Guntown, Miss. A severe battle ensued which lasted until about
4 p. M., when I regret to say my lines were compelled to give way before
the overwhelming numbers by which they were assailed at every point.
To fall back at this point was more than ordinarily difficult as there was
a narrow valley in our rear through which ran a small creek crossed by
a, single narrow bridge. The road was almost impassable by reason of
the heavy rains which had fallen for the previous ten days and the con¬
sequence was that the road soon became jammed by the artillery and
ordnance wagons. This gradually led to confusion and disorder.
"In a few minutes, however, I succeeded in establishing two colored
regiments in line of battle in a wood on this side of the little valley.
These troops stood their ground well and checked the enemy for a time.
The check, however, was only temporary and this line in turn gave way.
My troops were seized with a panic and became absolutely uncontrolla¬
ble. One and a half miles in rear by dint of great exertion and with pis¬
tol in hand, I again succeeded in checking up the flying column and plac¬
ing it in line of battle.
" This line checked the enemy for ten or fifteen minutes only, when it
again gave way and my whole army became literally an uncontrollable
mob. Nothing now remained to do but allow the retreat to continue and
endeavor to force it gradually into some kind of shape. The night was
exceedingly dark, the roads almost impassable and the hope of saving
