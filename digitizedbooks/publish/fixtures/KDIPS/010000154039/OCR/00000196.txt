History of the Black Phalanx.
"When at length, the government had arrived at a negro policy, and was arming
elaves, the president offered General Phelps a major-general's commission. He replied,
it is said, that he would willingly accept the commission if it were dated back to th€
•day of his resignation, so as to carry with it an approval of his course at Camp Para¬
pet. This was declined, and General Phelps remains in retirement. I suppose the presi¬
dent- felt that an indorsement of General Phelps' conduct would imply a censure o1
General Butler, whose conduct every candid person, I think, must admit, was just, for*
bearing, magnanimous."
General Butler was carrying out the policy of the Gov¬
ernment at that time, but it was not long before he found
it necessary to inaugurate a policy of his own for the
safety of his command. On the 5th of August Brecken-
ridge assaulted Baton Rouge, the capital of the State,
which firmly convinced General Butler of the necessity oi
raising troops to defend New Orleans. He had somewhat
realized his situation in July and appealed to the "home
authorities" for reinforcements, but none could be sent.
Still, the Secretary of "War said to him, in reply to his
application: " New Orleans must be held at all hazards."
With New Orleans threatened and no hope of rein¬
forcement, General Butler, on the 22d day of August, be¬
fore General Phelps had retired to private life, was obliged
to accept the policy of arming negroes. He issued the fol¬
lowing order:
"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
general ordehs " New orleans, August 22,1862.
no. 63.
"Whereas on the 23d day of April, in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-one, at a
public meeting of the free colored population of the city of New Orleans, a military
organization, known as the "Native Guards "(colored,) had its existence, which mili¬
tary organization was duly and legally enrolled as a part of the militia of the State,
its officers being commissioned by Thomas O. Moore, Governor and Commander-in-
Chief of the militia of the State of Louisiana, in the form following, that is to say:
"' The State op Louisiana.
