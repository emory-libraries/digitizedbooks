History of the Black Phalanx.
was in. I did not see it myself, because I had sat down, as I had been
working so hard.
'Question. How do you know they made their movement while the
flag of truce was in ? 'Answer. The men that were above said so. The
rebs are bound to take every advantage of us. I saw two more white
men close to where I was lying. That makes three dead ones, and my¬
self wounded."
Later on during the war the policy of massacring was
somewhat abated, that is it was not done on the battle¬
field. The humanity of the confederates in Virginia per¬
mitted them to take their black prisoners to the rear.
About a hundred soldiers belonging to the 7th Phalanx
Regiment, with several of their white officers, were cap¬
tured at Fort Gilmer on the James River, Va., and taken
to Richmond in September, 1864. The following account
is given of their treatment in the record of the Regiment:
" The following interesting sketches of prison-life, as experienced by
two officers of the regiment, captured at Fort Gilmer, have been kindly
furnished. The details of the sufferings of the enlisted men captured
with them we shall never know, for few of them ever returned to tell the
sad story.
" 'An escort was soon formed to conduct the prisoners to Richmond,
some seven or eight miles distant, and the kinder behavior of that part of
the guard which had participated in the action was suggestive of the free¬
masonry that exists between brave fellows to whatever side belonging.
On the road the prisoners were subjected by every passer-by, to petty in¬
sults, the point in every case, more or less obscene, being the color of
their skin. The solitary exception, curiously enough, being a nymph du
pave in the suburbs of the town.*
" 'About dusk the prisoners reached the notorious Libby, where the
officers took leave of their enlisted comrades—from most of them for¬
ever. The officers were then searched and put collectively in a dark hole,
whose purpose undoubtedly was similar to that of the 'Ear of Dionys-
9 ius.' In the morning, after being again searched, they were placed
among the rest of the confined officers, among whom was Capt. Cook, of
the Ninth, taken a few weeks previously at Strawberry Plains. Some
time before, the confederates had made a great haul on the Weldon Rail¬
road, and the prison was getting uncorhfortably full of prisoners and—
vermin. After a few days sojourn in Libby, the authorities prescribed a
change of air, and the prisoners were packed into box and stock cars
and rolled to Salisbury, N. C. The comforts of this two day's ride are
* " When the successful attempt was made, by tunneling, to escape from Libby
Prison in 1862, many of the fugitives were honorably harbored by this unfortunate
class till a more quiet opportunity occurred for leaving the city. This I have from on®
of the escaped officers."
