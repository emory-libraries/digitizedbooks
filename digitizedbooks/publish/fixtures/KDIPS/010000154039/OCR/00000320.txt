shall be made by said Government according to the rules and regula¬

in the absence of such law, in accordance with such rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, as the Secretary of War
shall from time to time prescribe; Provided, That no impressment of
slaves shall be made, when they can be hired or procured by the owner
or agent.
"Sec. 10.—That, previous to the 1st day of December next, no slave
laboring on a farm or plantation, exclusively devoted to the production
of grain and provisions, shall be taken for the public use, without the
consent of the owner, except in case of urgent necessity."
