CHAPTER I.
PUBLIC OPINION.
It seems proper, before attempting to record the
achievements of the negro soldiers in the war of the
Rebellion, that we should consider the state of public
opinion regarding the negroes at the outbreak of the war;
also, in connection therewith, to note the rapid change
that took place during the early part of the struggle.

white people in the Colonies and in the States, came to

reasons are alleged for it, but the difficulty of really solv¬

this country came without prejudice against color. The
Negro, Egyptian, Arab, and other colored races known to
them, lived in European countries, where no prejudice, on
account of color existed. How very strange then, that a
feeling antagonistic to the negroes should become a
prominent feature in the character of the European emi¬

held by some writers that the American prejudice against
the negroes was occasioned by their docility and unresent-
