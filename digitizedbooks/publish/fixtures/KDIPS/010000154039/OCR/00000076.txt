History of the Black Phalanx.
into the Chesapeake. Barron struck his colors without
firing a shot, and permitted the officers of the Leopard to
board his vessel and search her. The British captain
refused to accept the surrender of the Chesapeake, but
took from her crew the three men who had been demanded
as deserters; also a fourth, John Wilson, a white man,
claimed as a runaway from a merchant ship.
The white sailor, it was admitted by the American
government, was a British subject, and his release was not
demanded; he was executed for deserting the British Navy.
Of the negroes, two only were returned by the British gov¬

an American historian:

President Jefferson very soon interdicted American harbors and
waters to all vessels of the English Navy, and forbade intercourse with
them. He sent a vessel of war with a special minister to demand satis¬

three black men with a reprimand, blaming them for disturbing the
peace of two nations. That the outrage did not end in immediate war,

insisted upon its right to, and issued orders for the search
for British sailors to be continued; thus a cause for quar¬
rel remained.
The principal grounds of war, set forth in a message
of the President to Congress, June 1st, 1812, and further
explained by the Committee On Foreign Kelations, in their
report on the subject of the message, were summarily:
" The impressment of American seamen by the British; the blockade
of her enemy's ports, supported by no adequate force, in consequence of
which the American commerce had been plundered in every sea, and the
great staples of the country cut off from their legitimate markets; and
the British orders in council."
On these grounds, the President urged the declaration
of war. In unison with the recommendation of the Presi¬
dent, the Committee on Foreign Kelations concluded their
reports as follows:
