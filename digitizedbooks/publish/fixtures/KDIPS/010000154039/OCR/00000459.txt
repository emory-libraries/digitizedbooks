The Phalanx in Virginia.
457
encamped for the night, some of the citizens poured forth pitiful tales to
our officers. They told how our cavalry had entered their houses and
ripped open their feather beds, how the rude troopers had broken open
bureaus and chests in search of valuables, and how they had carried
away with them what they could find. Nothing of interest took place
until the 8th, which was noted for the forced march made by the brigade,
starting at day-break and going into bivouac at twelve midnigh£. The
morning of the 9th broke calm and serene. It was a lovely morning,
the sun had not yet gotten above the horizon when the brigade was on
the march again, but it went only a short distance when it was halted.
To the right of the road, in a clearing, was a portion of the Twenty-
fourth Corps, with arms stacked and the men cooking breakfast. Sides
of bacon at intervals hung from their bayonets. Although the woods
were full of our cavalry and three divisions of our infantry were in close
proximity, all was as quiet as a Sabbath morning. One of our batteries,
some six hundred yards to the right, broke the stillness by fitfully
throwing a shell once in a while, but to a looker-on all seemed inaction.
Such was the situation at Appomattox at sunrise on the morning of
the 9th.
" Our brigade, after resting some thirty minutes, resumed the march.
It soon filed to the right. In a few minutes the command was given—
'Eight shoulder,-shift p,rms! double quick, march!' Onward we went,
the objective point being the Lynchburg pike. Dismounted cavalry
retreating from the front broke through the column, saying as they
passed us, 'Give it to them, boys! they are too many for us!' In a few
minutes the head of the column reached the pike, when it halted and
faced to the front. The command—' Unsling knapsacks!'—was given,
and then we knew we were stripping for a fight. Skirmishers were
deployed on our front, and as we advanced the Confederate skirmishers
retired before us. After advancing some eight hundred yardsthe brigade
was ordered to halt and form in line of battle. It formed into column
of companies. Some eight hundred yards away was the Army of North¬
ern Virginia, with its three lines of battle awaiting us.
"We had not been at a halt more than twenty minutes when the
news of Lee's surrender reached us. Our brigade celebrated theevent by
firing volleys of musketry in the air. Officers hugged each other with
joy. About four hundred yards to the rear was a portion of the Twenty-
fourth Corps, which had been marching to our support. The men in
that long line threw their caps upwards until they looked like a flock of
crows. From wood and dale came the sound of cheers from thousands
of throats. Appomattox will never hear the like again. The brigade
moved forward a short distance and went into camp some three hundred
yards from the Confederate camp. In the afternoon I strolled over the
ground we had traversed in the morning. I came across the body of a
dead Confederate soldier, covered with a blanket. Some one had taken
the shoes from his feet. Uncovering him I found that a shot had pierced
his right breast. His white cotton shirt was matted with blood. A
