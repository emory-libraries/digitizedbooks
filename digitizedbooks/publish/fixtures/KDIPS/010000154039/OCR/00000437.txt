charged and carried Fort Harrison and a long line of rebel works.
Soon after noon, while the brigade, which had been moving by the flank
down the New Market road, had halted in the road, orders came to
form column of regiments, faced to the left, in the woods. Scarcely had
this been done when Gen. Vm. Birney, commanding brigade, rode up to
the right of the column and ordered the Seventh to move off by the
right flank. As it was crossing the Mill road, Col. Shaw reached the
head of the line and received from him the order to " form on the right
by file into line, and charge and take the work that is firing," and add¬
ing, " if that work is taken when you reach it, push right on and take
the next before Gen• Foster can get there." In the meantime the Ninth
had charged a work on the right and had been repulsed, and the com¬
manding officer of the Eighth had been ordered to send four companies
deployed as skirmishers to take the work to the left, but when Major
THE PHALANX AT NEW MARKET HEIGHTS. *
* "On the 29th of September, 1864, Gen. Grant ordered Gen. Butler to cross the
James River, at Two Points, and attack the enemy's line of work, in the centre of
which was Fort Harrison; on the left, at New Market Heights, was a very strong work,
the key of the enemy's flank on the north side of the river. It was a redoubt built on
the top of a hill of some considerable elevation, then running down into a marsh. In
that marsh was a brook—then rising again to a plain, which gently rolled toward the
river. On that plain, when the flash of dawn was breaking. Butler placed a column of
the black Phalanx," [which consisted of the 5th, 3(Sth, 38th and 2nd Cavalry Regts.],
"numbering three thousand, in close column, by division, right in front, with guns at
'right shoulder shift.' The center of the line was given to the eighteenth corps, com¬
posed of white troops, Under Gen. Ord, and they drove the enemy from a very strong
work, capturing several pieces of cannon.
"Gen. Butler had been severely criticised by officers of the regular army for organ¬
izing twenty-five regiments of negroes. 'Why,' said they, 'they will not fight.' In
contradiction of this assertion Butler made up his mind to prove the worth and value
of the black Phalanx. Notwithstanding their gallantry at Petersburg and on the
Fredericksburg road, the metal of the 25th corps of the Army of the James was to be
tried; so Butler took command of the Phalanx himself with a determination to set at
rest forever the question of the fighting capacity of a. portion of his command. Ad¬
dressing the Phalanx, he said, pointing to the works on the enemy's flank, 'those
works must be taken by the weight of your column; not a shot must be fired.' In
order to prevent them from firing he had the caps taken from the nipples of their guns.
•When you charge,' he said, 'your cry will be 'Remember Fort Pillow."
"'Twas in the early grey of the morning, ere the sun had risen. The order 'for¬
ward ' set the column in motion, and it went forward as if on parade—down the hill,
across the marsh, and as the column got into the brook they came within range of
the enemy's fire, which was vigorously opened upon them. The column broke a little •
as it forded the brook, it wavered! What a moment of intense anxiety! But they
formed again, as they reached the firm ground, marching on steadily with close ranks
under the enemy's fire, until the head of the column reached the first line of abatis,
some one hundred and fifty yards from the enemy's work. Then the axemen ran to
tihe front to cut away the heavy obstacles of defense while one thousand men of the
enemy with their artillery concentrated poured from the redoubt a heavy fire upon the
head of the column of fours. The axemen went down under that murderous fire;
other strong black hands grasped the axes in their stead and the abatis was cut away.
Again, at double-quick, the column went forward to within fifty yards of the fort, to
meet there another line of abatis. The column halted and there a very fire of Jjell was
poured upon them. The abatis resisted and held the head of the column which liter¬
ally melted away under the rain of shot and shell; the flags of the leading regiments
went down, but a brave black hand seized the colors. They were soon up again and
waved their starry light over the storm of battle. Again the axemen fell, but strong
hands and willing hearts seized the heavy sharpened trees and dragged them away,
and the column rushed forward and with a shout that rang out above the roar of
artillery went over the redoubt like a flash, and the enemy did not stop running within
four miles, leaving the Phalanx in possession of their deemed impregnable work, can¬
nons and small arms. The autocrats of the regular army could croak no longer
about the negro soldiers not fighting.
"This gallantry of the Phalanx won for them and the negro race the admiration
of the man who suppoted Jeff Davis and the slave power in the Charleston conven¬
tion in 1S60. Ten years after this spendid victory of the Phalanx, in support of their
Civil rights,' General Butler then a member of congress, made an eloquent appeal in
