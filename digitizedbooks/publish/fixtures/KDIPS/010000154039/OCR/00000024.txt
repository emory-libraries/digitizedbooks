History of the Black Phalanx.
histories and literature, and from the correspondence of
men who in that period discussed the topics of the day
who led and fashioned public opinion, many of whom com¬
manded in the field. Not a few biographers have contribu¬
ted to my fund of knowledge. To avoid as much as possi¬
ble the charge of plagiarism I have aimed to give credit to
my informants for what shall follow regarding the colored
patriots in the war of the Revolution. I have reason to
believe that I have gathered much that has been obscure;
iihat I have exhumed the bones of that noble Phalanx who,
•at Bunker Hill and Yorktown, in various military employ¬
ments, served their country. It is true they were few in
number when compared to the host that entered the
service in the late Rebellion, but it must be remembered

independence, if referred to the army, can easily be seen.
'The Northern colonies furnished two hundred and forty-
nine thousand, five hundred and three, and the Southern
colonies one hundred and forty-seven thousand, nine huh-
<dred and forty soldiers, though the whole population of
each section was within a few hundred of being equal.
The love of liberty was no less strong with the Southern
than with the Northern colored man, as their efforts for
liberty show. At the North he gained his freedom by
entering the American army; at the South, only by enter¬
ing the British army, which was joined by more than fifteen
thousand colored men. Jefferson says 30,000 negroes
from Virginia alone went to the British army. I make the
digression simply to assert that had the colored men at
the South possessed the same opportunity as those at the
