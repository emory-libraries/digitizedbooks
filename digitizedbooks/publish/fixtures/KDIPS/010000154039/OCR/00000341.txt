The Black Flag.

the Seventh were among the fortunate, and from that day none knew
hunger more.
" 'With the advent of the boxes came the dawn of a brighter day.
Cartels of exchange were talked about, and by the middle of February
the captives found themselves on the rail for Richmond. The old Libby
appeared much less gloomy than on first acquaintance, the rays of hope
throwing a halo about everywhere. Many asked and obtained the lib¬
erty of the town to lay in a supply of those fine brands of tobacco for
which Richmond is famous. In a few days the preliminaries to exchange1
were completed, and on the 22d of February—Washington's birthday—
the captives also stepped into a new life under the old flag."
■"Captain Sherman, of Co. C., gives the following account:
" 'Further resistence being useless, and having expressed our willing¬
ness to surrender, we were invited into the fort. As I stepped down from
the parapet I was immediately accosted by one of the so-called F. F.
V.'s, whose smiling countenance and extended hand led me to think I
was recognized as an acquaintance. My mind was soon disabused of
that idea, however, for the next instant he had pulled my watch from its
pocket, with the remark, 'what have you there?' Quick as thought,
and before he could realize the fact, I had seized and recovered the watch,
while he held only a fragment of the chain, and placing it in an inside
pocket, buttoned my coat and replied, 'that is my watqh and you can¬
not have it.'
'"Just then I discovered Lieut. Ferguson was receiving a good deal
of attention—a crowd having gathered about him—and the next mo¬

soldiers, and he stood hatless. Seeing one of the rebel officers with a
Masonic badge on his coat, Lieut. F. made himself known as a brother
Mason, and'appealed to him for redress. The officer quickly responded
and caused the hat to be returned to its owner, only to be again stolen,
and the thief made to give it up as before.
'"In a little while we (seven officers and eighty-five enlisted men)
were formed in four ranks, and surrounded by a guard, continued the
march ' on to Richmond,' but under very different circumstances from
what we had flattered ourselves would be the case, when only two orthree
hours before our brigade-commander had remarked, as he rode by the
regiment, that we would certainly be in Richmond that night. We met a
great many civilians, old and young, on their way to the front, as a gen¬
eral alarm had been sounded in the city, and all who could carry arms had
been ordered to report for duty in the intrenchinents. After a few miles
march we halted for a rest, but were not allowed to sit down, as I pre¬
sume* the guards thought we could as well stand as they. Here a squad
jof the Richmond Grays, the elite of the city, came up and accosted us
with all manner of vile epithets. One of the most drunken and boister¬
ous approached within five or six feet of me, and with the muzzle of his
rifle within two feet of my face swore he would shoot me. Fearless of
consequences, and feeling that immediate death even could not be worse
