tiously to a point about one and a half miles distant, sometimes called
Cross Roads, but more generally known as Poison Springs, where he
came upon a skirmish line of the enemy, which tended to confirm his pre¬
vious suspicion of the character and purpose of the enemy. He there¬
fore closed up the train as well as possible in this thickly timbered region,
and made the necessary preparations for fighting. He directed the cav¬
alry, under Lieutenant Henderson, of the 6th, and Mitchell, of the 2nd,
to charge and penetrate the the rebel line of skirmishers, in order to
develop their strength and intentions. The movement succeeded most
admirably in its purposes, and the development was such that it con¬
vinced Colonel Williams that he had before him a struggle of no ordinary
magnitude.
"The cavalry, after penetrating the skirmish line, came upon a
strong force of the enemy, who repulsed and forced them back to their
original line, not, however, Without hard fighting and severe loss on our
part in killed and wounded, including in the latter the gallant Lieuten¬
ant Henderson, who afterwards fell into the hands of the enemy.
" The enemy now opened on our lines with ten pieces of artillery—six
in front and four on the right flank. From a prisoner Colonel Williams
learned that the force of the enemy was from eight to ten thousand, com¬
manded by Generals Price and Maxey. These developments and this in¬
formation convinced him that he could not hope to defeat the enemy;
but as there was no way to escape with the train except through their
lines, and as the train and its contents were indispensable to the very
existence of our forces at Camden, who were then out of provisions, he
deemed it to be his duty to defend the train to the last extremity, hoping
that our forces at Camden, on learning of the engagement, would attack
the enemy in his rear, thus relieving his command and saving the train.
With this determination, he fought the enemy's entire force from 10
A. m. until 2 p. m., repulsing three successive assaults and inflicting upon
the enemy severe loss.
" In his report Colonel Williams says:
' The conflict during these four hours wa,a the most terrific and deadly in its charac¬
ter of any that haa ever fallen under my observation.'
"At 2 p. m. nearly one-half of our force engaged had been placed
hors de combat, and the remainder were out of ammunition. No sup¬
plies arriving, the Colonel was reluctantly compelled to abandon the
train to the enemy and save as much of the command as possible by
taking to the swamps and canebrakes and making for Camden by a
circuitous route, thereby preventing pursuit by cavalry. In this manner
most of the command that was not disabled in the field reached Camden
during the night of the 18th. For a more specific and statistical report
of this action, in which the loss to the 1st Colored alone was 187 men
and officers, the official report of Colonel J. M. Williams is herewith
