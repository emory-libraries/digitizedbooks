was agreed between you and the engineer that a removal of the wood between Lake
Pontchartrain and the right of your intrenchment was a necessary military precau¬
tion. The work could not be done at that time because of the stage of water and the
want of men. But now both water and men concur. You have five hundred Africans
organized into companies, you write me. This work they are fitted to do. It must
either be done by them or my soldiers, now drilled and disciplined. You have said the
location is unhealthy for the soldier; it is not to the negro ; is it not best that these un¬
employed Africans should do this labor? My attention is specially called to this mat¬
ter at the present time, because there are reports of demonstrations to be made on
your lines by the rebels, and in my judgment it is a matter of necessary precaution
thus to clear the right of your line, so that you can receive the proper aid from the
gun-boats on the lake, besides preventing the enemy from having cover. To do this the
negroes ought to be employed; and in so employing them I see no evidence of 'slave-
driving ' or employing you as a ' slave-driver.'
" The soldiers of the Army of the Potomac did this very thing last summer in front
of Arlington Heights; are the negroes any better than they?
" Because of an order to do this necessary thing to protect your front, threatened
by the enemy, you tender your resignation and ask immediate leave of absence. I as¬
sure you I did not expect this, either from your courage, your patriotism, or your
good sense. To resign in the face of an enemy has not been the highest plaudit to a
soldier, especially when the reason assigned is that he is ordered to do that which a re¬
cent act of congress has specially authorized a military commander to do, i. e., employ
the Africans to do the necessary work about a camp or upon a fortification.
" General, your resignation will not be accepted by me, leave of absence will not be
granted, and you will see to it that my orders, thus necessary for the defense of the
city, are faithfully and diligently executed, upon the r esponsibility that a soldier in the
field owes to his superior. I will see that all proper requisitions for the food, shelter,
and clothing of these negroes so at work are at once filled by the proper departments.
You will also send out a proper guard to protect the laborers against the guerilla
force, if any, that may be in the neighborhood.
"I am your obedient servant,
"Benj. F. Butler, Major-General Commanding.
"Brigadier-General J. W. Phelps, Commanding at Camp Parapet."
On the same day, General Butler wrote again to Gen¬
eral Phelps:
" New Orleans, August 2,1862.
" General :—By the act of congress, as I understand it, the president of the
United States alone has the authority to employ Africans in arms as a part of the
military forces of the United States.
"Every law up to this time raising volunteer or militia forces has been opposed to
their employment. The president has not as yet indicated his purpose to employ the
Africans in arms.
"The arms, clothing, and camp equipage which I have here for the Louisiana vol¬
unteers, is, by the letter of the secretary of war, expressly limited to white soldiers, so
that I have no authority to divert them, however much I may desire so to do.
"I do not think you are empowered to organize into companies negroes, and drill
them as a military organization, as I am not surprised, but unexpectedly informed you
have done. 1 cannot sanction this course of action as at present advised, specially
when we have need of the services of the blacks, who are being sheltered upon the out¬
skirts of your camp, as you will see by the orders for their employment sent you by
the assistant adjutant-general.
" I will send your application to the president, but in the mean time you must de¬
sist from the formation of any negro military organization.
" I am your obedient servant,
" Benj. P. Butler, Major-General Commanding.
"Brigadier-General Phelps, commanding forces at Camp Parapet."
General Phelps' resignation was accepted by the Gov¬
ernment. He received notification of the fact on the 8th
of September and immediately prepared to return to his
farm in Yermont. In parting with his officers, who were,
like his soldiers, much attached to him, he said: "And
now, with earnest wishes for your welfare, and aspirations
for the success of the great cause for which you are here, I
bid you good-bye." Says Parton:
