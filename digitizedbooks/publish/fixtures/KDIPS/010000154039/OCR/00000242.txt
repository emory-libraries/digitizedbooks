History of the Black Phalanx.
"On the day following, May 1st, 1864, Colonel Williams was ordered
to take command of the 2nd Brigade, composed of the following Pha¬
lanx regiments: 1st Regiment, commanded by Major Ward; 2nd
Regiment, commanded by Colonel S. J. Crawford; 11th Regiment, com¬
manded by Lieut.-Col. James M. Steele; 54th Regiment, Lieut.-Col. Chas.
Fair ;of the Frontier Division 7th Army Corps.^
" Colonel Williams never afterwards resumed direct command of his
regiment. It constituted for most of the time, however, a part of the
Brigade, which he commanded until he was mustered out of service with
the regiment.
" The regiment remained with the Division at Little Rock until some
time during the month of May, when it Marched for Fort Smith,—then
threatened by the enemy,—at which point it arrived during the same
month. This campaign was one of great fatigue and privation, and
accomplished only with great loss of life and material, with no adequate
recompense or advantage gained.
"The regiment remained on duty at Fort Smith until January 16th,
1865, doing heavy escort and fatigue duty. On the 16th of September,
1864, a detachment of forty-two men of Co. K, commanded by Lieut.
D. M. Sutherland, while guarding a hay-making party near Fort Gibson,
were surprised and attacked by a large force of rebels under Gen. Gano,
and defeated after a gallant resistence, with a loss of twenty-two killed
and ten prisoners—among the latter the Lieutenant commanding. On
the 16th of January, 1865, the regiment moved to Little Rock, where it
arrived on the 31st of the same month, here it remained on duty until
July 1865, when it was ordered to Pine Bluffs, Ark. Here it remained,
doing garrison and escort duty, until October 1st, 1865, when it was
mustered out of service and ordered to Fort Leavenworth for final pay¬
ment and discharge. The regiment received its final payment and was
discharged at Fort Leavenworth on the 30th day of October, 1865."
The heroism of the negro people of Kansas was not all
centered in this one regiment. Elated with the success of
their brethren already in the field, there was a general
desire to emulate their heroic deeds. In June, 1863, the
second regiment was organized at Fort Scott. The regi¬
mental organization was completed at Fort Smith, Ark.,
by the mustering in of the field and staff officers.
The regiment went into camp on the Poteau River,
about two miles south of Fort Smith. Here the work of
drill and discipline was the daily routine of duty until the
regiment maintained a degree of proficiency second to
none in the Army of the Frontier.
On the 24th of March, 1864, the regiment left Fort
Smith and started on what was known as the Camden Ex-
