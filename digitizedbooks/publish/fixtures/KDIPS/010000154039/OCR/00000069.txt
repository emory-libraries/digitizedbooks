The "War of 1775.

Cornwallis doubtless had gathered within his lines a
large number of negroes, to whose energy and labor, the
erection of his breastworks were mainly due. Lafayette
feeling satisfied that the position of his army before York-
town would confine the British, and make the escape of
Cornwallis impossible without battle, wrote to Gen. Wash¬
ington in September :
"I hope you will find we have taken the best precautions to lessen
his Lordship's escape. I hardly believe he will make the attempt. If he
does, he must give up ships, artillery, baggage, part of his horses, and
all the negroes."
All this time in some of the Northern States an oppo¬
sition as strong as at the South had existed against
organizing negro troops, and in some instances even
against employing them as soldiers. The effort for sepa¬
rate organizations had been going on, but with only the
little success that has been already noticed. In a bio¬
graphical sketch of Col. David Humphreys, in the "Nation¬
al Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans," is the
following:
"In November, 1782, he was, by resolution of Congress, commis¬
sioned as a Lieutenant-Colonel, with order that his commission should
bear date from the 23rd of June, 1780, when he received his appoint¬
ment as aid-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief. He had, when in ac¬
tive service, given the sanction of his name and influence in the establish¬
ment of a company of colored infantry, attached to Meigs', afterwards
Butler's, regiment, in the Connecticut line. He continued to be the nomi¬
nal captain of that company until the establishment of peace."
Though the Legislature of Connecticut had taken up
the subject of arming negroes generally, as early as
1777, and a bill, as we have seen, was presented to that
Legislature, for their enrollment, the advocates of the
measure, in every attempt to pass it, had been beaten.
Nevertheless, as appears by the record given above, Col.
Humphrey took charge and 'organized a company, with
which he served until the close of the war. But this com¬
pany of fifty odd men were not all that did service in the
army from Connecticut, for in many of her white regi¬
ments, negroes, bond and free, stood in the ranks with the
whites. And, notwithstanding the unsuccessful attempts
