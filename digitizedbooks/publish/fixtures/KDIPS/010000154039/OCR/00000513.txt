neither was with us at the time, afterwards subscribed a like amount.
Others responded in the same spirit. Officers and men entered into the
work with enthusiasm. The lieutenants gave $50 each; officers of
higher rank, $100. First Sergeant Brown, Co D, gave $75; Sergeants
Curd, Bergamire, Alexander and Moore each gave $50, while the number
who gave 25, 20, 15, 10, and 5 dollars apiece is too great for me to
recall their names on this occasion, but they are all preserved in our
records. The total result in the 62nd Regiment was $1,034.60, contrib¬
uted by the officers, and $3,966.50 by the colored soldiers. The soldiers
of the 65th Regiment afterwards added $1,379.50. One of them, Sam¬
uel Sexton, gave $100 from his earnings as a private soldier at $13 per
month, an example of liberality that may1 well challenge comparison
with the acts of those rich men who, from their surplus, give thousands
to found colleges.'*
Colonel David Branson, late of the 62nd Regiment,
in his dedicatory speech, said:
" My Friends :—This, with one exception, has been the happiest 4th
of July in my life. That exception was in 1863, when I saw the rebel
flag go down at Yicksburg. I felt the exultation of victory then, and I
feel it to-day as I look upon this splendid building. Looking in the
faces of my old comrades of the 62nd Regiment here to-day, memory
goes back to the past, when hundreds of you came to me at Benton
Barracks, ragged, starving, and freezing—some did freeze' to death—and
emotions fill me that no language can express. I cannot sit down and
think of those scenes of suffering without almost shedding tears. But
happily those days are passed. JNo more marching with sluggish step
and plantation gait through the streets of St. Louis, Mo., amid the
jeers of your enemies; no more crossing the Mississippi on ice; no more
sinking steamers, and consequent exposure on the cold, muddy banks
of the river; no more killing labor on fortifications at Port Hudson,
Baton Rouge and Morganza; no more voyages over the Gulf of Mexico,
packed like cattle in the hold of a vessel; no mere weary marches in the
burning climate of Texas; no more death by the bullet, and no more
afternoons on the banks of the Rio Grande, deliberating on the future
education of yourselves when discharged from the army; but peace and
prosperity here with the result of those deliberations before us. Our
enemies predicted, that upon the disbanding of our volunteer army—
particularly the colored portion of it—it would turn to bands of ma¬
rauding murderers and idle vagabonds, and this Institute was our
answer."
When Colonel Shaw, of the 54th Regiment, fell at
Fort Wagner, the brave soldiers of that regiment gladly
contributed to a fund for a monument to his memory,
but which, upon reflection, was appropriated to building
