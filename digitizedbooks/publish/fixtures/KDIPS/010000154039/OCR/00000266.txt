History of the Black Phalanx.
that 800 were buried, and as a number were taken prisoners, and it is
fair to estimate that three were wounded to one killed, the total loss of
the Federals exceeded 3,000. The writer's official report estimates the
Federal loss at not less than 2,000; General Beauregard's at 3,000. The
Federal official reports have not been seen.
"The limits prescribed for this paper would be exceeded if any ac¬
count of the remaining forty-eight days of the heroic strife on Morris
Island were attempted. It closes with the repulse of the second assault,
and it is a fit conclusion to render the homage due to the gallantry of
the contestants by quoting and adopting the language of Dr. Dennison's
address: 'The truest courage and determination was manifested on both,

It was no longer a question of doubt as to the valor

Nobly did they do this, not only at Wagner, as we have
seen, but in the battles on James Island, Honey Hill, Olus-
tee and at Boykin's Mill.
In the winter of 1864, the troops in the Department of
the South lay encamped on the islands in and about
Charleston harbor, resting from their endeavors to drive
the confederates from their strongholds. The city was
five miles away in the distance. Sumter, grim, hoary and
in ruins, yet defying the National authority, was silent.
General Gillmore was in command of the veteran legions
of the 10th Army Corps, aided by a powerful fleet of iron¬
clads and other war vessels. There laid the city of Charles¬
ton, for the time having a respite. General Gillmore was
giving rest to his troops, before he began again to throw
Greek fire into the city and batter the walls of its defences.
The shattered ranks of the Phalanx soldiers rested in the
