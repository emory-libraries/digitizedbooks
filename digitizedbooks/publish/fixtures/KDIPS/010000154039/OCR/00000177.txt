Department, dated January 1863, as well as the battal¬
ion, which he was also ordered to raise for scouting pur¬
poses, the following March, included many men of rank.
To command a negro regiment or company was at this
date a coveted prize, for which men of wealth and educa¬
tion contended. The distinction which they were contin¬
ually winning for their officers, frequently overcame the
long-cherished prejudice of West Point, and the graduates
of this caste institution now vied for commissions in
negro regiments, in which many of them served during the
^Rebellion and since.
It was the idea of Gen. Banks when organizing the
Corps d' Afrique to appoint even the non-commissioned
officers from the ranks of white regiments, and he did so
in several instances. His hostility to negro officers was
the cause of his removing them from the regiments, which
Major General Butler organized at New Orleans in 1862.
In organizing the Corps d' Afrique, the Order, No. 40,
reads:
"The Commanding General desires to detail for temporary or per¬
manent duty, the best officers of the army, for the organization, instruc¬
tion, and discipline of this Corps. With them he is confident that the
Corps will render important service to the Government. It is not estab¬
lished upon any dogma of equality or other theory, but as a practical
and sensible matter of business. The Government makes use of mules,
horses, uneducated white men in the defence of its institutions; why
should npt the negro contribute whatever is in his power, for the cause
in which he is as deeply interested as other men? We may properly
demand from him whatever service he can render."
At first it was proposed to pay the officers of negro
troops less than was paid the officers of white soldiers, but
this plan was abandoned. Toward the close of the war
nearly all the chaplains appointed to negro regiments
were negroes; non-commissioned officers were selected from
the ranks, where they were found as well qualified as those
taken from the ranks of white regiments. In the 10th and
18th Corps it was a common thing for the orderly ser¬
geants to call their company's roll from memory, and the
records of many companies and regiments are kept at the
War Department in Washington, as mementoes of their
efficiency.
