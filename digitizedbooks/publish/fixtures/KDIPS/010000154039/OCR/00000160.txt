History of the Black Phalanx.
"Why not suggest to Mr. Stanton, General, that he should either
demand the special revocation of that ordei", or announce to the rebel
War Department that our Government has adopted your negro-regi¬
ment policy as its own—which would be the same thing.
"It was partly on this hint that Hunter-wrote the following letter to
Jefferson Davis,—a letter subsequently suppressed and never sent, owing
to influences which the writer of this article doe? not feel himself as yet
at liberty to reveal,—further than to say that Mr. Stanton knew noth¬
ing of the matter. Davis and Hunter, we may add, had been very old
and intimate friends, until divided, some years previous to our late war,
by differences on the slavery question. Davis had for many years been
adjutant of the 1st U. S. Dragdons, of which Hunter had been Captain
Commanding; and a relationship of very close friendship had existed
between their respective families. It was this thorough knowledge of his
man, perhaps, which gave peculiar bitterness to Hunter's pen; and the
letter is otherwise remarkable as a prophecy, or preordainment of that
precise policy which Pres't. Johnson has so frequently announced, and re¬
iterated since Mr. Lincoln's death. It ran—with some few omissions, no
longer pertinent or of public interest—as follows:
"TO JEFFERSON DAVIS, TITULAR PRESIDENT OF THE SO-CALLED CONFED¬
ERATE STATES.
" Sib :—While recently in command of the Department of the South, in accordance
■with the laws of the war and the dictates of common sense, I organized and caused
to be drilled, .armed and equipped, a regiment of enfranchised bondsmen, known as the
1st South Carolina Volunteers.
"For this action, as I have ascertained, the pretended government of which you
are the chief officer, has issued against me and all of my officers who were engaged in
organizing the regiment in question, a General Order of Outlawry, which announces
that, if captured, we shall not even be allowed the usual miserable treatment extended
to such captives as fall into your hands; but that we are to be regarded as felons, and
to receive the death by hanging due to such, irrespective of the laws of war.
" Mr. Davis, we have been acquainted intimately in the past. "We have campaigned
together, and our social relations have been such as to ma,ke each understand the other
thoroughly. That you mean, if it be ever in your power, to execute the full rigor of
your threats, I am well assured; and you will believe my assertion, that I thank you
for having raised in connection with me and my acts, this sharp and decisive issue. I
ehall proudly accept, if such be the chance of war, the martyrdom you menace; and
hereby give you notice that unless your General Order against me and my officers be
formally revoked, within thirty days from the date of the transmission of this letter,
sent under a flag of truce, I shall take your action in the matter as finale; and will re¬
ciprocate it by hanging every rebel officer who now is, or may hereafter be taken, pris¬
oner by the troops of the command to which I am about returning.
"Believe me that I rejoice at the aspect now being given to the war by the course
you have adopted. In my judgment, if the undoubted felony of treason had been
treated from the outset as it deserves to be—as the sum of all felonies and crimes—this
rebellion would never have attained its present menacing proportions. The war you
and your fellow conspirators have been waging against the United States must be re¬
garded either as a war of justifiable defence, carried on for the integrity of the bound¬
aries of a sovereign Confederation of States against foreign aggression, or as the most
wicked, enormous, and deliberately planned conspiracy against human liberty and for
the triumph of treason and slavery, of which the records of the world's history contain
any note.
"If our Government should adopt the first view of the case, you and your fellow-
