The War of 1775.

ing generations. And though the murderers may escape the just resent¬
ment of an enraged people; though drowsy justice, intoxicated by the
poisonous draft prepared for her cup, still nods upon her rotten seat, yet
be assured, such complicated crimes will meet their due reward. Tell
me, ye bloody butchers! ye villains high and low! ye wretches who con¬
trived, as well as you who executed the inhuman deed! do you not feel
the goads and stings of conscious guilt pierce through your savage bos¬
oms? Though some of you may think yourselves exalted to a height
that bids defiance to human justice, and others shroud yourselves
beneath the mask of hypocrisy, and build your hopes of safety on the
low arts of cunning, chicanery and falsehood; yet do you not sometimes
feel the gnawings of that worm which never dies; do not the injured
shades of Maverick, Gray, Cadwell, Attucks and Carr, attend you in
your solitary walks; arrest you in the midst of your debaucheries and

"Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that as the
contest now between Great Britain and the Colonies respects the liberties
and privileges of the latter, which the Colonies are determined to main¬
tain, that the admission of any persons, as soldiers, into the army now
raising, but such as are Freeman, will be inconsistent with the prin¬
cipals that are supported, and reflect dishonor on this Colony; and that
no Slaves be admitted into this army upon any consideration whatever."
The exception was well taken, and this act of the Com¬
mittee, excluding slaves from the army, placed the rebels
upon the basis of patriots, fighting for freedom. This,
however, did not detract from those who had already dis¬
tinguished themselves, by their bravery at Bunker Hill a
few weeks previous, where Peter Salem, once a slave,
fought side by side in the ranks with the white soldiers.
