History of the Black Phalanx.
that I should be held personally responsible that they were put on board
his own steamer, and this when I had neither men nor muskets to en¬
force the order. Fortunately (for myself) Gen. Birney's steamer arrived
first and the men were safely put on board. Some days later, Lieut.
Brown, who was then in charge of the same station, had a squad of
recruits taken from him by Col. Nelson, in retaliation.
"Many a hap-hazard journey was undertaken in search of recruits
and recruiting stations. On one occasion an officer was ordered by Gen.
Birney to take station at a town (?) not many miles from Port Tobacco,
on the Potomac. After two days' careful search he discovered that the
town he was in search of had been a post-office twenty years before, but
then consisted of one house, uninhabited and uninhabitable, with not
another within the circuit of five miles."
When the Government decided to arm the negroes
and ordered the organization of a hundred regiments, it
was with great difficulty the equipment department met
the requisitions. It necessitated a departure from the
accustomed uniform material for volunteers, and helped
to arouse the animosity of the white troops. Instead of
the coarse material issued at first, the Phalanx was
clothed in a fine blue-black dress coat for the infantry,
and a superb dark blue jacket for the artillery and cav¬
alry, all neatly trimmed with brass buttons and white,
red and yellow cord, representing the arm of service;
heavy sky blue pantaloons, and a flannel cap, or high
crown black flelt hat or chapeau with a black feather
looped upon the right side and fastened with a brass
eagle. For the infantry and for the cavalry two swords
crossed; for the artillery two cannons on the front of the
chapeau crossed, with the letters of the company, and
number of the regiment to which the soldier belonged.
On the caps these insignias were worn on the top of the
crown. The uniform of the Phalanx put the threadbare
clothes of the white veterans in sad contrast, and was the
cause of many a black soldier being badly treated by his
white comrades.*
* I attempted to pass Jackson Square in New Orleans one day in my uniform, when
I was met by two white soldiers of the 24th Conn. They halted me and then ordered
me to undress. I refused, when they seized me and began to tear my coat off. I resist¬
ed, but to no good purpose; a half a dozen others came up and began to assist. I rec¬
ognized a sergeant in the crowd, an old shipmate on board of a New Bedford, Mass.,
"Whaler; he came to my rescue, my clothing was restored and I was let go. It was
nothing strange to see a black soldier a la, Adam come into the barracks out of the
streets. This conduct led to the killing of a portion of a boat's crew of the U S
Gunboat Jackson, at Ship Island, Miss., by members of a, Phalanx regiment stationed
there.
