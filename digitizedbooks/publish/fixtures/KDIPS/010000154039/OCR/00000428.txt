History of the Black Phalanx.
Many of the correspondents at the seat of war, igno¬
rant of the real facts regarding the assault, attributed
the failure, not to General Meade's interference with
General Burnside's plan, but to the Phalanx division, the
men who bore the brunt of the battle and gained for
themselves a fame for desperate fighting. But some of
those who were acquainted with the facts have left records
that tell the true storyand give honor to whom honor is
due. Gen. Grant is among the number; he perfectly under¬
stood the whole matter, knew that General Burnside, not
being allowed to carry out his own plans, but at the last
moment compelled to act contrary to his judgment, could
not fight with that enthusiasm and confidence that he
would have done had he been allowed to carry out his
own ideas. In his "Memoirs," General Grant gives an
account of the explosion of the mine and the assault after
placing the blame for the "stupendous failure" where it
belongs. I quote a few preliminary words which not only
intimate Where the trouble lies, but gives the key to the
whole matter. Speaking of General Burnside's command,
he says:
" The four divisions of his corps were commanded by Generals Pot¬
ter, Wilcox, Ledlie and Ferrero. The last was a colored division; and
Burnside selected it to make the assault. Meade interfered with this.
Burnside then took Ledlie's division—a worse selection than the first
could have been. * * * * Ledlie, besides being otherwise inefficient,
proved also to possess disqualifications less common among soldiers."
A correspondent of the New York Evening Post says :
"We have been continually notified for the last fortnight, that our
sappers were mining the enemy's position. As soon as ready, our divis¬
ion was to storm the works on its explosion. This rumor had spread
so wide we had no faith in it. On the night of the 29th, we were in a
position on the extreme left. We were drawn in about nine p. m., and
marched to General Burnside's headquarters, and closed in mass by
division, left in front. We there received official notice that the long-
looked-for mine was ready charged, and would be fired at daylight next
morning. The plan of storming was as follows: One division of white
troops was to charge the works immediately after the explosion, and
carry the first and second lines of rebel intrenchments. Our division,
was to follow immediately, and push right into Petersburg, take the
city, and be supported by the remainder of the Ninth and Twenty-
