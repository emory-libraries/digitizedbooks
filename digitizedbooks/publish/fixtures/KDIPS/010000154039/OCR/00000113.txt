Recruiting and Organizing. Ill
CHAPTER II.
RECRUITING AND ORGANIZING.
The recruiting officer, in the first year of the enlist¬
ment of negroes, did not have a pleasant service to per¬
form. At New Orleans there was no trouble in recruiting
the regiments organized under Butler's command, for,
beside the free negroes, the slave population for miles
around were eager to enlist, believing that with the United
States army uniform on, they would be safe in their
escape from " ole master and the rebs." And then the
action of the confederate authorities in arming the free
negroes lent a stimulent and gave an ambition to the
whole slave population to be soldiers. Could arms have
been obtained, a half a dozen regiments could have been
organized in sixty days just as rapidly as were three.
Quite early in 1862, while the negroes in New Orleans
were being enrolled in the Confederate service, under Gov.
Moore's proclamation, in separate and distinct organiza¬
tions from the whites, the Indians and negroes were enlist¬
ing in the Union service, on the frontier, in the same com¬
pany and regiments, with white officers to command
them. In th§ "Kansas Home Guard," comprising two
regiments of Indians, were over 400 negroes, and these
troops were under Custer, Blunt and Herron. They held
Fort Gibson twenty months against the assaults of the
enemy. Two thousand five hundred negroes served in the
Federal army from the Indian Nations, and these, in all
probability, are a part of 5,896 "not accounted for" on
the Adjutant General's rolls.
Quite a different state of things existed in South Caro-
