The Black Flag.

and put an end to the exchange, and resolved to go with the party that
day, if possible. I had noticed that the clerk had not called the names
in their order nor checked them, and knew he could not tell who had been
called. I therefore hurried down to the lower floor and fell in with the
rest, thinking all the time of the possibility of detection and the conse¬
quent solitary confinement, and although my conscience was easy so far
as the papers I had signed were concerned—for I had only agreed not to
take up arms until duly exchanged—I did not breath freely until I had
disembarked from the boat and was under the Stars and Stripes. For*
tunately, the rest of the party came down on the boat the next day.
"' One other incident and I am done: Sergt. Henry Jordan, of Com¬
pany C, was wounded and captured with the rest of us, but on account
of his wounds was unable to be sent South with the other enlisted-men.
After his recovery he was kept as a servant about the office of Major Tur¬
ner, the commandant of the prison, and when, on the 2d of April, 1865,
the rebels evacuated Richmond and paroled the prisoners, he remained
until our forces came in and took possession of the city. When, a few
days later, Maj. Turner was captured by our troops and confined in the
same cell we had occupied, Sergt. Jordan was detailed to carry him his
rations, and although he was not of a vindictive or revengeful disposi¬
tion, I will venture to say that the rations allowed Turner were not
much better than had been given the sergeant through the winter. Had
Turner been guarded by such men as Henry Jordan, or even by the poor¬
est soldiers of the regiment, he would not have escaped within three days
of his capture, as was the case.'"
Yery few of the black soldiers were exchanged, though,
the confederate government pretended to recognize them
and treat them as they did the whites. General Taylor's
reply to General Grant, was the general policy applied to
them when convenient. In the latter days of the war, when
—in June, 1864, at Gnntown, Miss.,—the confederate Gen.
Forrest attacked and routed the Union forces, under Stur-
gis, through the stupidity of the latter, (alluded to more
at length a few pages further on,) a number of black
soldiers were captured, Sturgis having had several Pha¬
lanx regiments in his command. The confederates fought
with desperation, and with their usual " no quarter,"
because, as Forrest alleges, the Phalanx regiments meant
to retaliate for his previous massacre of the blacks at
Fort Pillow. Seeking to justify the inhuman treatment
of his black prisoners, he wrote as follows to General
Washburn, commanding the District of West Tennessee:
