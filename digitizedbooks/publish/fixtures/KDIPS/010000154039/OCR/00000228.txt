History of the Black Phalanx.
57th, 59th and 83rd Phalanx regiments. The brigade
was ordered to Texas overland, but the surrender of Gen¬
eral Lee to Grant obviated this march. The gallant 60th
was mustered out at Davenport, Iowa, on the 2nd of Nov¬
ember, 1865, "where," says Sergeant Burton, the regi¬
mental historian, "they were greeted by the authorities
and the loyal thousands of Iowa."
Kansas has undoubtedly the honor of being the first
State in the Union to begin the organization of negroes as
as soldiers for the Federal army. The State was admitted
into the Union January 29, 1861, after a long reign of
hostilities within her borders, carried on by the same
character of men and strictly for the same purpose which
brought on the war of the Great Rebellion. In fact, it
was but a transfer of hostilities from Missouri and Kan¬
sas to South Carolina and Virginia. Missouri and the
South had been whipped out of Kansas and the territory
admitted into the Union as a free State. This single fact
was accepted by the South as a precursor of the policy of
the incoming Republican administration, and three South¬
ern senators resigned or left the United States Senate be¬
fore the vote was taken for the admission of Kansas. The
act of admitting Kansas as a free State, was the torch
that inflamed the South, and led to the firing upon Fort
Sutaiter the following April. The men of Kansas had long
been inured to field service, and used to practice with
Sharps' rifles. The men of Kansas, more than in any
other State of the Union, had a right to rush to the de¬
fence of the Federal government, and they themselves felt so.
On the 9th of February, eleven days after the admis¬
sion of the State into the Union, Governor Robinson took
the oath of office, and on the 15th of April President
Lincoln called for seventy-five thousand volunteers. The
first regiment responded to the call by the close of May;
others speedily followed, until Kansas had in the field
20,000 soldiers. Of the regiments and companies which
represented this State in the Federal army, several were
composed of negroes, with a slight mixture of Indians.
It has been no easy task to learn about these regi-
