History of the Black Phalanx.
the countersign. He said he had not the countersign; but amused the
sentry by talking about rebel prisoners, and still advancing till he came
within reach of the bayonet, which, he presenting, the colonel struck
aside, and seized him. He was immediately secured, and ordered to be
silent, on pain of instant death. Meanwhile, the rest of the men sur¬
rounding' the house, the negro, with his head, at the second stroke,
forced a passage into it, and then into the landlord's apartment. The
landlord at first refused to give the necessary intelligence; but, on the
prospect of present death, he pointed to the GeneraTs chamber, which
being instantly opened by the negro's head, the Colonel, calling the
General by name, told him he was a prisoner
Congress voted Col. Barton a magnificent sword, but
the real captor of Gen. Prescott, so far as known, received
nothing. A surgeon in the American army, Dr. Thacher,
writes, under date of Aug. 3d, 1777, at Albany:
"The pleasing information is received here that Lieut.-Col. Barton,
of the Rhode Island Militia, planned a bold exploit for the purpose of i
surprising and taking Maj.-Gen. Prescott, the commanding officer of the
Royal army at Newport. Taking with him, in the night, about forty -
men, in two boats, with oars muffled, he had the address to elude the '
vigilance of the ships-of-war and guard boats; and, having arrived un¬
discovered at the quarters of Gen. Prescott, they were taken for the sen¬
tinels ; and the general was not alarmed till the captors were at the door
of his lodging chamber, which was fast closed. A negro man, named
Prince, instantly thrust his beetle head through the panel door, and
t seized his victim while in bed. This event is extremely honorable to the
enterprising spirit of Col. Barton, and is considered an ample retaliation
for the capture of Gen. Lee by Col. Harcourt. The event occasions great
joy and exultation, as it puts in our possession an officer of equal rank
with Gen. Lee, by which means an exchange may be obtained. Congress
resolved that an elegant sword should be presented to Col. Barton, for
his brave exploit."
To recite here every incident and circumstance illus¬
trating the heroism and the particular services rendered
the patriotic army by negroes, who served in regiments
and companies with white soldiers, would fill this entire
volume. Yet, with the desire of doing justice to the mem- -
ory of all those negroes who aided in achieving the inde¬
pendence of America, I cannot forbear introducing notices,
—gathered from various sources,—of some prominent
examples.
