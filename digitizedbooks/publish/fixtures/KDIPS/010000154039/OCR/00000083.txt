The War of 1812.

ably not have lasted six months; certainly the invasion of
Canada would not have been attempted.
The reverses which met the American army in the first
year of the war, slackened even the enlistment that was
going on and imperiled the safety of the country, and the
defences of the most important seaports and manufactur¬
ing states. Battle after battle had been lost, the invasion
of Canada abandoned, and the British had turned their
attention southward. The war in Europe had been
brought to a close, and Napoleon was a captive. Eng¬
land was now at liberty to reinforce her fleet and army in
America, and fears were entertained that other European
powers might assist her in invading the United States.
The negro soldier again loomed up, and as the British

who should attempt to deceive you. In the sincerity of a soldier and
the language of truth I address you.
To every noble-hearted, generous freeman of color volunteering to
Berve during the present contest with Great Britain, and no longer, there
will be paid the same bounty, in money and lands, now received by the
