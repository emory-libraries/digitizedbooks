whose attention was called to the worthiness of the ser¬
vice rendered by Armistead.
The opposition to the employment of negroes as sol¬
diers, by the persistency of i£s advocates and the bravery
of those who were then serving in white regiments, was

ple. Washington needed reinforcements; nay, more, the
perilous situation of the army as it lay in camp at Valley
Forge, at the conclusion of the campaign of 1777, was
