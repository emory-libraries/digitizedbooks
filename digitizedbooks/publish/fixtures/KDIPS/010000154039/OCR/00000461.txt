The Phalanx in Virginia.

hopes, but hopes that were to be dissipated; soon the
bristling bayonets, and glistening musket barrels of the
Army of the James gleamed in their front; then the pres¬
sure ceased, and Sheridan's bugle sounded the order to
mount, and his troopers dashed themselves against the
enemy's left flank. Then, one bearing a white flag—a flag
of truce, rode to the front of the confederate lines. Capt.
J. D. Cook of General Mile's staff went forward to meet
him. It was Colonel Taylor of General Lee's staff; he bore
a note from Lee, asking a suspension of hostilities, and
an interview with General Grant. Now let us go back to
the night of the 6th, and trace the flying columns to this
point. Badeau says:
"That night once more the rebels evacuated their works, this time
in front of Meade, and when morning dawned were far on their way, as
they fondly thought, to Lynchburg, and Lee defiantly informed his pur¬
suer that the emergency for the surrender had not yet arrived. But he
reckoned without his host. He was stretching, with the terrific haste
that precedes despair, to Appomattox for supplies. He need haruly
have hastened to that spot, destined to be so fatal to himself and his
cause. Grant's legions were making more haste than he. The marvel¬
ous marching, not only of Sheridan, but of the men of the Fifth and
Twenty-Fourth Corps, was doing as much as a battle to bring the rebel¬
lion to a close. Twenty-eight, thirty-two, thirty-five miles a day in suc¬
cession these infantry soldiers marched, all day and all night. From
day-light until day-light again, after more than a week of labor and
fatigue almost unexampled, they pushed on to intercept their ancient
adversary, while the remainder of the Army of the Potomac was at his
heels.
"Finally Lee, still defiant, and refusing to treat with any view of
surrender, came up to his goal, but found the national cavalry had
reached the point before him, and that the supplies were gone. Still he
determined to push his way through, and with no suspicion that men
on foot could have marched from Rice's Station to his front in thirty
hours, he made his last charge, and discovered a force of infantry greater
than his own before him, besides cavalry, while two corps of the Army
of the Potomac were close in his rear. He had run straight into the
national lines. He was enclosed, walled in, on every side, with immi¬
nent instant destruction impending over him. He instantly offered to
submit to Grant, and in the agony of alarm, lest the blow should fall,
he applied to Meade and Sheridan also for a cessation of hostilities.
Thus in three directions at once he was appealing to be allowed to yield.
At the same moment he had messengers out to Sheridan, Meade, and
Grant. The emergency, whose existence he had denied, had arrived.
