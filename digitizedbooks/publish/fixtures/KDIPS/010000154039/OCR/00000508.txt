506 History of the Black Phalanx.
even, things unheard of in the camp life of these men. Besides in quite
a number of the colored regiments military bands were formed, and
under the instruction of sometimes a band teacher from the north, and
at others under one of their own proficient fellow-soldiers, these bands
learned to discourse most entertaining music in camp, and often by
their inspiriting strains did much to relieve the fatigue occasioned by
long and tiresome marches. But we are speaking now mainly of the
work of the school-teacher proper. And what shall we say of the hall&
of learning in which were gathered his eager pupils? Well, certainly
these would not compare favorably with those of civil life, as may well
be imagined. As says Bryant, truly and beautifully, speaking of primi¬
tive religious worship:
' The groves were God's first temples.'
So, too, in the groves and fields of their new land of liberty, these men
found their first temples of learning, and in spite of all inconveniences
these school tents were rendered quite serviceable. Of the text books
used there is not much to say, for these were generally 4 few and far
between.' Books were used at times, of course, but quite as often the
instruction given was entirely oral. That these spare facilities did not
render the teacher's efforts ineffective was abundantly proven in the
service, and has been proven since in civil life. Scattered here and there
over this broad country to-day are many veteran soldiers who are good
readers and writers, some of them even fair scholars, who took their
first lessons from some manly officer or no less manly fellow-soldier in
the manner mentioned, during such camp intervals as were allowed by
the dread arbitrament of war. In a number of regiments these fortu¬
nate intervals were quite frequent and of long duration, and in such
cases, therefore, much progress was made.
"It must, of course, be remembered that in our colored regiments a
very large percentage of the men were illiterate, especially in those com¬
posed of men from the south and so lately escaped from under the iron
heel of slavery. Indeed, in many of them there could scarcely be found
at the commencement of the service a man who could either read or
write. Many an officer can recall his rather novel experience in teaching
his first sergeant enough of figures and script letters to enable the latter
to make up and sign the company morning report. All honor to those
faithful, patient officers, and all honor, too, give to those ambitious
sergeants who after awhile conquered great difficulties and became
educationally proficient in their lines of duty.
"In this connection I readily call to mind one of the most, if not the
most, unique figures of all my experience in the army. It was Colonel
James Beecher, of the famous Beecher family, and a brother of Henry
Ward Beecher. He was in command of the First North Carolina Colored
Kegiment. In this position it would be hard to overestimate the variety
and value of his services, for he became for his soldiers at once a gallant
fighter, an eloquent, convincing preacher, and a most indefatigable and
