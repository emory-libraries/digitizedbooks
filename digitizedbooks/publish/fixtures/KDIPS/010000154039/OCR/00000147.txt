CHAPTER III.
RECRUITING AND ORGANIZING IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
"Private Miles O'Reilly" was the nom de plume of a
talented literary gentleman of the city of New York, who
wrote much in humorous prose and verse. His real name
was Charles G. Halpine. After an honorable service in the

killed or wounded in battle, or stricken down by the disease, toil and
privations incident to the life of a marching soldier, not belonging to
that class of prerogative for the exclusive enjoyment of which men of
sense, and with higher careers open to them, will long contend. Looking
back, however, but a few years, to the organization of the first regiment
of black troops in the departments of the South, what a change
