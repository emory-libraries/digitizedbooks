should be built essentially by freedmen, and should be emphatically
national. Every dollar should come from the former slaves, every State
should furnish a stone, and the monument should be erected at the capi¬
tal of the nation- Nothing could be better calculated to stimulate this
downtrodden and abused race to renewed efforts for a moral and
national status.
"Charlotte Scott, whose photograph General Smith will forward,
was born a slave in Campbell Couhty, Virginia. She is about sixty
years old, but is very hale and active. Her reputation for industry,
intelligence, and moral integrity, has always- been appreciated by her
friends and acquaintances, both white and colored. She was given, with
other slaves, to my wife, by her father, Thomas H. Scott. When we
received the news of Mr. Lincoln's assassination, the morning after its
occurrence, she was deeply distressed. In a conversation with Mrs.
Rucker, she said: ' The colored people have lost their best Mend on
earth. Mr. Lincoln was our best friend, and I will give five dollars of
my wages towards erecting a monument to his memory.' She asked me
who would be the best person to raise money for the purpose. I sug¬
gested Mr. Battelle, and she gave him the five dollars.
"I am, my dear sir, truly and respectfully,
"WILLIAM P. RUCKER."

" Mr. J. E. Yeatman.
" Dear Sir : I was providentially called upon by Charlotte Scott,
formerly a slave of Dr. W. P. Rucker, now living in this place, to receive
the enclosed $5, as the commencement of a fund to be applied to rearing
a monument to the memory of Hon. Abraham Lincoln.
" I received her offering, and gave notice through the press that I
would receive other donations, and cheerfully do what I could to pro¬
mote so noble an object. Other persons have signified their willingness
to give when the measure is fully inaugurated.
"By the advice of General T. C. H. Smith I herewith forward you
her contribution, and 1 hope to here from you upon its receipt, that I
may show to Charlotte and others that the money has gone in the right
direction. After hearing from you I hope to be able to stir up the other
colored folks on this subject.
" I rejoice, dear sir, that I have some connection with this honorable
movement in its incipiency. I shall not fail to watch its progress with
thrilling interest, and hope to live until the top stone shall be laid amid
the jubilant rejoicing of emancipated millions crying 'Grace, grace unto it.'
"Very respectfully yours,
"C. D. BATTELLE."
" The publication of the note of Mr. Yeatman, and the first com¬
munication received concerning the colored woman's proposed offering,
brought the following letters and contributions, showing how generous¬
ly the proposition of Charlotte Scott was responded to by the colored
troops stationed at Natchez, Miss. These contributions have been duly
deposited for safe keeping towards the Freedmen's National Monument
to Mr. Lincoln.
