If valor could have triumphed over such odds, the as¬
saulting forces would have carried the works, but only
a.bject cowardice or pitiable imbecility could have lost
such a position under existing circumstances. The negro
regiments on the north side of the works vied with the
bravest, making three desperate charges on the confeder¬
ate batteries, losing heavily, but maintaining their posi¬
tion in the advance all the while.
The column in moving to the attack wrent through the
woods in their immediate front, and then upon a plane, on
the farther side of which, half a mile distant, were the
enemy's batteries. The field was covered with recently
felled trees, through the interlaced branches of which the
column moved, and for two or more hours struggled
through the obstacles, stepping over their comrades who

On the left; the confederates had planted a six-gun battery
upon an eminence, wThich enabled them to sweep the field
over which the advancing column moved. In front was
the large fort, while the right of the line was raked by a re¬
doubt of six pieces of artillery. One after another of the
works had been charged, but in vain. The Michigan, New
York and Massachusetts troops—braver than whom none
ever fought a battle—had been hurled back from the
place, leaving the field strewn with their dead and woun-
