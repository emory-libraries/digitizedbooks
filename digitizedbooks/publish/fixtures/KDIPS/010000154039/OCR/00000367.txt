my artillery and wagons altogether futile, so I ordered the artillery and
wagons to be destroyed. The latter were burned and the former dis¬
mantled and spiked, that ie all but six pieces which we succeeded in bring¬
ing off in safety. By 7 a. m. next morning we reached Ripley (nineteen
miles). Here we re-organized and got into very respectable shape. The
retreat was continued, pressed rapidly by the enemy. Our ammunition
soon gave out, this the enemy soon discovered and pressed the harder.
Our only hope now lay in continuing the retreat which we did to this
place, where we arrived about 7 o'clock this morning.
"My losses in material of war was severe, being 16 guns and some
130 wagons. The horses of the artillery and mules of the train we
brought away. As my troops became very greatly scattered and are
constantly coming in in small parties, I am unable to estimate my loss,
in killed and wounded. I fear, however, it will prove severe, probably
ten or twelve hundred. While the battle lasted it was well contested and
I think the enemy's loss in killed and wounded will not fall short of our
own.
" This, general, is a painful record, and yet it was the result of a se¬
ries of unfortunate circumstances over which human ingenuity could
have no control.

try that the enemy had ample time to accumulate an overwhelming
force in our front, and kept us so long in an exhausted region as to so
starve and weaken our animals that they were unable to extricate the-
wagons and artillery from the mud.
" So far as I know every one did his duty well, and while they fought
no troops ever fought better. The colored troops deserve great credit
for the manner in which they stood to their work.
"This is a hasty and rather incoherent outline of our operations,
but I will forward a more minute account as soon as the official reports
can be received from division commanders.

An extract from a letter from Colonel Arthur T. Reeve,
who commanded the 55th Colored Infantry in this fight,
reads:
"Our (the Federal) command having been moved up on double-
quick—a distance of about five miles- -immediately before their arrival
on the field and the consequent fact that this arm of our force went into
the engagement very seriously blown, in fact, very nearly exhausted by
heat and fatigue, with their ranks very much drawn out, were whipped
in detail and overwhelmed by the very brilliant and vigorous assaults of
your forces. When the engagement first began I was at the rear of the
