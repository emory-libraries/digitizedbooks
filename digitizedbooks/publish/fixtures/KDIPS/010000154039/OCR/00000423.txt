The Phalanx in Virginia.

confederate Gen. Mahone, whose acquaintance the writer
enjoys, reciting the story of the light at the crater, where
the negro met the confederate, and in a hand-to-hand
struggle one showed as much brute courage as the other.
It would not be doing the negro justice to accord him
less, and yet that courage never led him to acts of inhu¬
manity, It is preferable that the confederates themselves
should tell the stories of their butcheries than for me to
attempt them. Not the stories told at the time, but
fifteen years afterward, when men could reflect and write
more correctly. There is one, an orator, who has de¬
scribed the fight, whose reference to the crater so glad¬
dened the hearts of his audience that they reproduced the
"yell," and yelled themselves hoarse. No battle fought
during the war, not even that of Bull Run, elicited so
much comment and glorification among the confederates
as that of the crater. It was the bloodiest fight on the
soil of the Old Dominion, and has been the subject of
praise by poets and orators upon the confederate side.
Capt. J. B. Hope eulogized "Mahone's brigade" in true
Southern verse. Capt. McCabe, on the 1st of November,
1876, in his oration before the "Association of the Army
of Northern Virginia," in narrating the recapture of the
works, said:
" It was now 8 o'clock in the morning. The rest of Potter's (Fed¬
eral) division moved out slowly, when Ferrero's negro division, the men,
beyond question, inflamed with drink, (there are many officers and men,
myself among the number, who will testify to this), burst from the ad¬
vanced lines, cheering vehemently, passed at a double quick over a crest
under a heavy fire, and rushed with scarcely a check over the heads of
tne white troops in the crater, spread to their right, and captured more
than two hundred prisoners and one stand of colors. At the same time
Turner, of the Tenth corps, pushed forward a brigade over the Ninth
Corps' parapet, seized the Confederate line still further to the north,
and quickly dispersed the remaining brigades of his division to confirm
his successes."
The truth is over-reached in the statement of this
orator* if he intended to convey the idea that the men of
the Phalanx division were drunk from strong drink; but
it may be looked upon as an excuse offered for the treat-
