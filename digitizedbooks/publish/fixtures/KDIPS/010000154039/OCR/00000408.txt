History of the Black Phalanx.
one piece of artillery in the most gallant manner. On their arrival be¬
fore Petersburg, they lay in front of the works for nearly five hours,
waiting for the word of command. They then, in company with the
white troops, and showing equal bravery, rushed and carried the
enemy's line of works, with what glorious success has already been rela¬
ted."
This, indeed, was a victory, yet shorn of its full fruits;
but that Petersburg was not captured was no fault of the
Phalanx. They had carried and occupied the most for¬
midable obstacles.
Badeau, in chronicling these achievements, says:
"General Smith assaulted the works on the City Point and Prince
George Court House roads. The rebels resisted with a sharp infantry
fire, but the center and left dashed into the works, consisting of five

was at his mercy."
This failure made a siege necessary, and General
Grant began by regular approaches to invest the place,
after making the three desperate assaults on the 16th,
17th and 18th. It had been indeed a bloody June; the
soil of the Old Dominion, which for two centuries the
negro had tilled and made to yield the choicest products,
under a system of cruel and inhuman bondage he now
reddened with his blood in defense of his liberty, proving
by his patriotism, not only his love of liberty, but his
courage and capacity to defend it. The negro troops had
marched and fought with the white regiments with equal
intrepidity and courage; they were no longer despised by
their comrades; they now had recognition as soldiers, and
went into the trenches before Petersburg as a part of as
grand an army as ever laid siege to a stronghold or
stormed a fortification.
On the 18th of June, General Ferrero reported to
General Meade, with his division of the Phalanx, (4th
