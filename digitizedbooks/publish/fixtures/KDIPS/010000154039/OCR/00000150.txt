History of the Black Phalanx.
screaming, riotous ridicule of their late associates in the white regi-
nents. "We remember one very striking instance in point, which we shall
five as a sample of the whole.
" Our friend Mr. Charles F. Briggs, of this city, so well known in lit¬
erary circles, had a nephew enlisted in that excellent regiment the 48th
New York, then garrisoning Fort Pulaski and the works of Tybee Island.
This youngster had raised himself by gallantry and good conduct to be
a non-commissioned officer; and Mr. Briggs was anxious that he should
be commissioned, according to his capacities, in the colored troops then
being raised. The lad was sent for, passed his examination with credit,
and was immediately offered a first lieutenancy, with the promise of be¬
ing made captain when his company should be filled up to the required
standard,—probably within ten days.
"The inchoate first-lieutenant was in ecstasies; a gentleman by birth
and education, he longed for the shoulder-straps. He appeared joyously
grateful; and only wanted leave to run up to Fort Pulaski for the pur¬
pose of collecting his traps, taking leave of his former comrades, and
procuring his discharge-papers from Col. Barton. Two days after that
came a note to the department headquarters respectfully declining the
commission! He had been laughed and jeered out of accepting a cap¬
taincy by his comrades; and this—though we remember it more accur¬
ately from our correspondence with Mr. Briggs—was but one of many
scores of precisely similar cases.
"At length, however,#officers were found; the ranks were filled; the
men learned with uncommon quickness, having the imitativeness of so
many monkeys apparently, and such excellent ears for music that all
evolutions seemed to come to them by nature. At once, despite all hos¬
tile influence, the negro regiment became one of the lions of the South ;
and strangers visiting the department, crowded out eagerly to see its eve¬
ning parades and Sunday-morning inspection. By a strange coinci¬
dence, its camp was pitched on the lawn and around the mansion of
Gen. Drayton, who commanded the rebel works guarding Hilton Head,
Port Royal and Beaufort, when the same were first captured by the joint
naval and military operations under Admiral DuPont and General
Timothy W. Sherman,—General Drayton's brother, Captain Drayton of
our navy, having command of one of the best vessels in the attacking
squadron; as he subsequently took part in the first iron-clad attack on
Fort Sumpter.
"Meantime, however, the "War Department gave no sign, and the
oracles of the Adjutant-General's office were dumb as the statue of the
Sphynx. Reports of the organization of the First South Carolina in¬
fantry were duly forwarded to army headquarters; but evoked no com¬
ment, either of approval or rebuke. Letters detailing what had been
done, and the reason for doing it; asking instructions, and to have com¬
missions duly issued to the officers selected; appeals that the department
paymaster should be instructed to pay these negro troops like other
soldiers; demands that the Government should either shoulder the respon-
