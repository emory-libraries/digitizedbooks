urnn, followed by my own regiment. The men were swinging along
' arms at will,' when they spied General Thomas and staff approaching.
"Without orders they brought their arms to 'right shoulder shift,' took
the step, and striking up their favorite tune of 'John Brown,' whistled
it with admirable effect while passing the General, greatly to his amuse¬
ment.
"We had a very memorable march from Franklin to Murfreesboro,
over miserable dirt roads. About December 19th or 20th, we were on
the march at an early hour, but the rain was there before us, and stuck
by us closer than a brother. We were drenched through and through,
and few had a dry thread. We waded streams of water nearly waist
deep; we pulled through mud that seemed to have no bottom, and where
many a soldier left his shoes seeking for it. The open woods pasture
where we went into camp that night, was surrounded with a high fence
made of cedar rails. That fence was left standing, and was not touched
—until—well, I do believe that the owners bitterness at his loss was fully
balanced by the comfort and good cheer which those magnificent rail
fires afforded us that December night. They did seem providentially
provided for us.
"During the night the weather turned cold, and when we resumed
our march the ground was frozen and the roads were simply dreadful,
especially for those of our men who had lost their shoes the day before
and were now compelled to walk barefoot, tracking their way with blood.
Such experiences take away something of the romance sometimes sug¬
gested to the inexperienced by the phase,' soldiering in the Sunny South,'
but then a touch of it is worth having for the light it throws over such
historical scenes as those at Valley Forge.
" We continued in the pursuit of Hood, as far as Huntsville, Ala.,
when he disappeared to return no more, and we were allowed to go back
to Chattanooga, glad of an opportunity to rest. Distance travelled,
420 miles.
"We had no more fighting. There were many interesting experi¬
ences, which, however, I will not take time to relate. In August, 1865,
being in command of the Post at Ivnoxville, Tenn., grateful to have
escaped without imprisonment, wounds, or even a day of severe illness,
1 resigned my commission, after forty months of service, to resume my
studies.
" I cannot close this paper without expressing the conviction that
history has not yet done justice to the share borne by colored soldiers in
the war for the Union. Their conduct during that eventful period, has
been a silent, but most potent factor in influencing public sentiment,
shaping legislation, and fixing the status of colored people in America.
If the records of their achievements could be put into such shape that
they could be accessible to the thousands of colored youth in the South,
they would kindle in their young minds an enthusiastic devotion to
manhood and liberty."
