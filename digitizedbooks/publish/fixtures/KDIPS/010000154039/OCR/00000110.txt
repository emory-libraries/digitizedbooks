History of the Black PhAlanx.
important bearing upon our foreign relations. It evoked in behalf of
our country that sympathy on the part of the people in Europe, whose
is the only sympathy we can ever expect in our struggle to perpetuate
free institutions. Possessing that sympathy, moreover, we have had an
element in our favor which has kept the rulers of Europe in wholesome
dread of interference. The Proclamation I'elieved us from the false posi¬
tion before attributed to us of fighting simply for national power. It
placed us right in the eyes of the world, and transferred men's sympa¬
thies from a confederacy fighting for independence as a means of estab¬
lishing slavery, to a nation whose institutions mean constitutional
liberty, and, when fairly wrought out, must end in universal freedom."
The change of policy and of public opinion was so
strongly endorsed that it affected the rebels, who shortly
passed a Congressional measure for arming 200,000
negroes themselves. What a reversal of things; what a
change of sentiment, in less than twenty-four months!*
Mr. Lincoln, in justifying the change, is reported to have
said to Judge Mills, of Wisconsin:
"The slightest knowledge of arithmetic will prove to any man that
the rebel armies cannot be destroyed with Democratic strategy. It
would sacrifice all the white men of the North to do it. There are now
in the service of the United States near two hundred thousand able-
bodied colored men, most of them under arms, defending and acquiring
Union territory. The Democratic strategy demands that these forces be
disbanded, and that the masters be conciliated by restoring them to
slavery. The black men who now assist Union prisoners to escape, they
are to be converted into our enemies in the vain hope of gaining the
good will of their masters. We shall have to fight two nations instead
of one. You cannot conciliate the South if you guarantee to them ulti¬
mate success; and the experience of the present war proves their success
is inevitable if you fling the compulsory labor of millions of black men
into their side of the scale. Will you give our enemies such military
advantages as insure success, and then depend on coaxing, flattery, and
concession to get them back into the Union? Abandon all the posts
now garrisoned by black men; take two hundred thousand men from
our side and put them in the battlefield or cornfield against us, and we
would be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks. We have to
hold territory in inclement and sickly places; where are the Demo-
* "Those who have declaimed loudest against the employment of negro troops
have shown a lamentable amount of ignorance, and an equally lamentable lack of
common sense. They know as little of the military history and martial qualities of
the African raee as they do of their own duties as commanders.
All distinguished generals of modern times who have had opportunity to use negro
soldiers, have uniformily applauded their subordination, bravery, and powers of endur¬
ance. Washington solicited the military services of negroes in the revolution, and re¬
warded them. Jackson did the same in the war of 1812. Under both those great cap-
■tains, the negro troops fought so well that they 'received unstinted praise."—Charles
