History of the Black Phalanx.
indeed distressing. The encampment consisted of huts,
and there was danger of a famine. The soldiers were
nearly destitute of comfortable clothing. "Many," says
the historian, "for want of shoes, walked barefoot on the
frozen ground; few, if any, had blankets for the night.
Great numbers sickened; near three thousand at a time
were incapable of bearing arms."
Within fifteen miles of them lay the city of Philadel¬
phia and the British army. These gloomy circumstances
overshadowed the recent victory at Bennington, and the
surrender of Burgoyne. Under these circumstances, the
difficulty of recruiting the patriot army may be easily
imagined. A general enlistment bill had failed to pass the
legislature in the spring, because, perhaps, the spirit of the
patriots were up at the time; but now they were down,
and the advocates of arming negroes sought the opportu¬
nity of carrying their plan. It was not attempted in Con¬
necticut, but in the General Assembly of Rhode Island an
act was passed for the purpose. Here are some of the
principal provisions of this act :
"It is Voted and Resolved, That every able-bodied negro, mulatto,
or Indian man slave in this State, may enlist into either of the said two
battalions to serve during the continuance of the present war with
Great Britain; that every slave so enlisted shall be entitled to receive all
the bounties, wages, encouragements allowed by the Continentlal Con¬
gress to any soldier enlisted into their service.
"It is farther Toted and Resolved, That every slave so enlisting
shall, upon his passing muster before Col. Christopher Greene, be imme¬
diately discharged from the service of his master or mistress, and be
absolutely free, as though he had never been encumbered with any kind
of servitude or slavery. And in case such slave shall, by sickness or
otherwise, be unable to maintain himself, he shall not be chargable to
his master or mistress, but shall be supported at the expense of the State.
"And whereas slaves have been by the laws deemed the property of
their owners; and therefore compensation ought to be made to the own¬
ers for the loss of their service,—
"It is farther Voted and Resolved, That there be allowed, and paid
by this State to the owners, for every such slave so enlisting, a sum
according to his wTorth at a price not exceediug one hundred and twenty
pounds for the most valuable slave, and in proportion for a slave of less
value; Provided the owner of said slave shall deliver up to the officer
who shall enlist him the clothes of said slave; or otherwise he shall not
be entitled to said sum."
