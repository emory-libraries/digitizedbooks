The Phalanx in Virginia.

the main body, they entered and clambered up the steep
embankments. A sheet of flame from above was rained
down, causing many a brave man to stagger and fallback
into the ditch, never to rise again. The troops following,
inspired by the daring of the skirmishers, pressed forward
on the run up to the forts, swept round the curtains,
scaled the breastworks and dashed with patriotic rage at
the confederate gunners, who deserted their pieces and
ran for their lives. Brooks and Martindale advanced
simultaneously upon the works at Osborn's house and up
the railroad, sweeping everything before them. The Pha¬

bayonet, out of their breastworks, killing and capturing
their comrades and their guns. They were chided by their
brother confederates for allowing negroes to take their
works from them. The maidens of the Cockade City were
told that they could not trust themselves to men who
surrendered their guns to " niggers." The soldiers of the
Phalanx were delirious with joy. They had caught "ole
massa," and he was theirs. General Hinks had their con¬
fidence, and they were ready to follow wherever he led.
The chaplin of the 9th Corps, in his history, says:
"In this movement a division of colored troops, under Brigadier-
General Hinks, seems to have won the brightest laurels. They first
attacked and carried the enemy's putpost at Bailey's farm, capturing
