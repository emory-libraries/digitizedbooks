History of the Black Phalanx.
eral Walker. 'Why,' said he, 'young gentlemen, I might have founded
an empire.'
"While at Chattanooga, I organized two other regiments, the 42nd
and the 44th United States Colored Infantry. In addition to the ordin¬
ary instruction in the duties required of the soldier, we established in
every company a regular school, teaching men to read and write, and
taking great pains to cultivate in them self-respect and all manly quali¬
ties. Our success in this respect was ample compensation for our labor.
The men who went on picket or guard duty, took their books as quite as
indispensable as their coffee pots.
" It must not be supposed that we had only plain sailing. Soon after
Teaching Chattanooga, heavy details began to be made upon us for men
to work upon the fortifications then in process of construction around
the town. This almost incessant labor, interfered sadly with our drill,
and at one time all drill was suspended, by orders from headquarters.
There seemed little prospect of our being ordered to the field, and as
time wore on and arrangements began in earnest for the new campaign
against Atlanta, we grew impatient for work, and anxious for oppor¬
tunity for drill and preparations for field service.
"I used every means to bring about a change, for I believed that the
ultimate status of the negro was to be determined by his conduct on the
battle-field. No one doubted that he would work, while many did doubt
that he had courage to stand up and fight like a man. If he could takfe
his place side by side with the white soldier; endure the same hardships
on the campaign, face the same enemy, storm the feme works, resist the
same assaults, evince the same soldierly qualities, he would compel that
respect which the world has always accorded to heroism, and win for
himself the same laurels which brave soldiers have always won.
" Personally, I shrink from danger, and most decidedly prefer a safe
corner at my own fireside, to an exposed place in the face of an enemy on
the battle-field, but so strongly was I impressed with the importance of
giving colored troops a fair field and full opportunity to show of what
mettle they were made, that I lost no chance of insisting upon our right
to be ordered into the field. At one time I was threatened with dismis¬
sal from the service for my persistency, but that did not deter me, for
though I had no yearning for martyrdom, I was determined if possible
to put my regiment into battle, <at whatever cost to myself, As I look
back upon the matter after twenty-one years, I see no reason to regret
my action, unless it be.that I was not even more persistent in claiming
for these men the rights of soldiers.
"I was grievously disappointed when the first of May, 1864, came,
and the army was to start south, leaving us behind to hold the forts we
had helped to build.
"I asked General Thomas to allow me, at least, to go along. . He
readily consented, and directed me to report to General O. 0. Howard,
commanding the 4th Army Corps, as Volunteer Aide. I did so, and re¬
mained with him thirty days, participating in the battles of Buzzard's
