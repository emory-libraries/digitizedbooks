of the War Department, but the muster by no means
dates the organization of the troops.* For example, a
colonel may have been commissioned July, 1862, and yet
the muster of his regiment may be September 1862, and
even later, by two months, as is the case in more than one
instance. It is just as fair to take the date *of a soldier's
enlistment as the date of the organization of a regiment,
as that of the date of the order detailing an officer to
recruit as the date of the colonel's commission. The
writer's discharge from the Second Reg't. Louisiana Na¬
tive Guards credits him as enlisting on the 1st day of
September, 1862; at this date the 1st" Reg't. La. N. G. was
in the field, in November the Second Regiment took the
field, so that the date of the organization of the first
regiment of colored troops was in September, 1862. Col.
Higginson, says in his volume :
"Except the Louisiana soldiers mentioned,—of whom no detailed
reports have, I think, been published,—my regiment was unquestionably
the first mustered into the service of the United States; the first com¬
pany mustered bearing date, November 7, 1862, and the others follow¬
ing in quick succession."
Save the regiments recruited in Arkansas, South Caro¬
lina and New Orleans during the year 1862, nothing was
done towards increasing the negro army, but in January
1863, when the policy of the Government was changed
and the Emancipation Proclamation foreshadowed the
employment of negroes in the armed service, an activity
* Col. Thomas "Wentworth Higginson in an appendix to his "Army Life in a Black
Begiment," gives some account-of the organization of negro troops, from which is con¬
densed the following:
" It is well known that the first systematic attempt to organize colored troops dur¬
ing the war of the rebellion was the so-called "Hunter Regiment." The officer originally
detailed to recruit for this purpose was Sergeant C. T Trowbridge, of the New York
Volunteer Engineers (Col. Serrell.) His detail was dated Hay 7, 1862, S. O. 84, Dept.
South.
"The second regiment in order of muster was the First Kansas Colored, datingfrom
January 13, 1863. The first enlistment in the Kansas regiment goes back to August
6, 1862; while the earliest technical date of enlistment in my regiment was October 19,
1862, although, as was stated above, one company really dated its organization back
to May, 1862. My muster as Colonel dates back to November 10, 1862, several months
earlier than any other of which I am aware, among colored regiments, except that of
Col. Stafford, (First Louisiana Native Guards,) Sept. 27, 1892. Colonel Williams, of
the First Kansas Colored, was mustered as Lt. Colonel on Jan. 13,1863; as Col., March
8, 1863. These dates I have (with the other facts relating to the regiment) from Col.
E. J. Hinton, the first officer detailed to recruit it.
"The first detachment of the Second South Carolina Volunteers (Col. Montgomery)
vent into camp at Port Royal Island, February 23, 1863, numbering one hundred and
twenty men. I do not know the date of his muster; it was somewhat delayed, but was
probably dated back to about that time.
"Recruiting for the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts (colored) began on February 9,
1863, and the first squad went into camp at Readville, Massachusetts, on February
21, 1863, numbering twenty-five men. Col. Shaw's commission—and probably hi's
muster—was dated April 17, 1863. (Report of Adjutant General of Massachusetts for
1863, pp. 896-809.) These were the earliest colored regiments, so far as I know."
