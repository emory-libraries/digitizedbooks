History of the Black Phalanx.

to do, do it in that direction."
The confederates made a dash for the train and cap¬
tured twenty-seven wagons, but before they had time to
feast off of their booty the Phalanx: was upon them.
The enemy fought with uncommon spirit; it wTas the first
time "F. F. T's," the chivalry of the South,—composing
the Army of Northern Virginia,—had met the negro sol¬

what it meant, and prepared for their coming. A moment

not permitted to remain quiet in his intrenchments. The
confederates felt divined to destroy, if not capture, his
base, and therefore were continually striving to break
through the lines. On the 24th of May, General Fitzhugh
Lee made a dash with his cavalry upon Wilson's Wharf,
Butler's most northern outpost, held by two Phalanx
Regiments of General Wilde's brigade. Lee's men had
been led to believe that it was only necessary to yell at
