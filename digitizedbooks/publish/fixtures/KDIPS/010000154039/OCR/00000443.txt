The Phalanx in Yikginia.

" This day proved the most unfortunate one in the history of the
regiment. The storming of a strong field-work, whose garrison was on
the alert, with a thin skirmish line without supports, resulted as could
easily have been foreseen. First, the Ninth was sent unsupported to
charge a work to the left of Fort Gilmer, across an open field where its
line was enfiladed by the enemy's fire, and was repulsed; then four com¬
panies of the Eighth, as skirmishers, were sent against the same work,
with no better success, and after this bitter experience, four companies
of the Seventh were sent to their destruction on an errand equally hope¬
less. Had the brigade been sent together, instead of its three regiments
in detail, the rebel line would have been carried and the road to Rich¬
mond opened to us. This is no conjecture. The testimony of a rebel
staff-officer on duty at Fort Gilmer, and that of our own officers who
were captured, fully substantiate the statement.
"About noon on the following day, the 30th, the regiment moved a
mile to the left and went into the rifle-pits to the left of Fort Harrison.
Soon after, the rebel Maj.-Gen. Field, who had commanded .the Ft. Gilmer
line the day previous, made a determined assault on Fort Harrison from
one side, while Hoke's division attacked on the other; but the attack
was not made simultaneously and was repulsed with heavy loss. While
this charge was being made, Col. Shaw was struck on the head by a rifle
bullet, but was uninjured. The next morning the rebels opened their
batteries on our line. During the cannonade, Lieut. Bjornmark was
wounded in the foot by the fragment of a shell.
"The following is the report of Capt. Weiss to the commanding
officer of the regiment, announcing his arrival in Richmond:
"Libby Prison, Richmond, Ya., September 30,1864.
"'Sir:—I respectfully inform you that the following officers of the
Seventh U. S. C. T. are here, prisoners: Capts. Weiss and McCarty,
Lieuts. Mack, Sherman, Eler, Ferguson and Spinney. Lieut. Ferguson
and myself are wounded in the head, but doing well.
" ' Please inform our friends of the above, and oblige,
" 'Yours, on the part of my associates,
"'JULIUS A. WEISS,
"' Capt. Seventh U. S. C. T.'
" On the 5th of October, the regiment was relieved from duty in the
trenches by the Eight, and moving a short distance to the rear, went
into camp near division headquarters.
" On the 6th, Gen. Birney divided the regiments of his command
into two brigades. The First Brigade, composed of the Seventh, Ninth
and One Hundred and Twenty-seventh, was placed under command of
Col. Yoris, of the Sixty-seventh Ohio, although each regiment had a
colonel serving with it; and the Second, composed of the Eighth, Twen¬
ty-ninth and Forty-fifth, under Lieut.-Col. Armstrong, of the Ninth.
Capt. Rice returned from sick-leave the same day and was assigned to
the command of Company A, his own company (K) having disappeared
in the melee of the 29th of September.
