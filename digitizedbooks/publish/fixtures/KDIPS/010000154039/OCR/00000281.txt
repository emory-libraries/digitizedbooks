Department of the South.

A wild triumphant yell,
As back the army fell
One single sharp report!
A hundred muHkets peal,—
Stunned, bleeding, faint.
' Forward!' They quickly spring
With leveled bayonet;
Each eye is firmly set
Upon that pathway wet
With crimson gore.
As when some mighty rock
Obstructs the torrent's course,
After the moment's pause
Twill rush with greater force
Besistless on.
That 'Balaklava' dash!
Hight through 1he leaden hail.
O'er dyke and timbers frail,
With hearts that never fail
They boldly charge.
A moment's pause and then,
Our leader from his post.
Viewing the stricken host,
Cried ' Comrades, all is lost
If we now fail!'
Facing the scathing fire
Without a halt or break;
Save when with moan or shriek,
In the blood-mingled creek
The wounded fall.
Forming in single file,
They gaze with bated breath,
Around—before—beneath—
On every hand, stern Death
His visage showed.
What could resist that charge?
Above the battle's roar,
There swells a deafening cheer
Telling to far and near,
The Mill is won!
The slaughter was terrible, and among the killed was
young Lieutenant Stevenson, a graduate of Harvard.
The affair was an unnecessary sacrifice of human life, for
the war was over, peace had been declared, and President
Lincoln had been assassinated; but in the interior of the
Carolinas, the news did not reach until it was too late
to prevent this final bloodshed of the war. Perhaps it
may be regarded as a fitting seal of the negro to his new
covenant with freedom and his country.
The very large number of negro troops which General
Gillmore had under his command in the Department of the
South, afforded him a better opportunity to test their fit¬
ness for and quality as soldiers, than any other comman¬
der had. In fact the artillery operations in Charleston
harbor, conducted throughout with remarkable engineer¬
ing skill, perseverence and bravery, won for General Gill-
more and his troops the attention and admiration of the
civilized world, and an exceptional place in the annals of,
military siege. Such fame is sufficient to prompt an inquiry
into the capacity of the men who performed the labor of
planting tjie "Swamp Angel," which threw three hundred
pound shot into the heart of Charleston, more than four
miles away, and also mounted the six 200-pound cannons
which demolished the forts in the harbor two miles dis¬
tant. The work of mounting these immense guns in
swamp and mud could only be done by men who feared
neither fatigue, suffering nor death. After the accomplish¬
ment of these worlds, wonders, and the subjugation of
