History of the Black Phalanx.
On the 24th. of May the 25th Corps began embarking
for Texas by way of Mobile Bay. The troops, however,
occupied Texas but a short time, the confederate forces
there surrendering upon the same terms as those of Gen¬
eral Lee. All fears having been dissipated, the troops
were slowly mustered out of the United States service.
The men returned to their wonted fields of labor to pro¬
vide for their long-neglected families, upon a new career of
peace and happiness, rising, Phoenix like, from the ashes
of slavery to join the Phalanx of industry in upbuilding
the greatness of their country, which they had aided in
saving from desolation and ruin.
Such is the history of the negro in the wars of the
United States. Coming to its shores in the condition of
slavery, it required more than two centuries for the entire
race to reach the estate of freedom. But the imperishable
records of their deeds show that however humble and
despised they have been in all political and social relations
they have never been wanting in patriotism at periods of
public peril. Their devotion has been not only unappreci¬
ated, but it has failed to receive a fitting commemoration
in pages of national history. It has been the purpose of
the writer of this volume to relate herein the patriotic
•career of the negro race in this country in an authentic
and connected form. In the time to come the race will
take care of itself. Slavery is ended, and now they are
striking off link by link the chains of ignorance Which the
servitude of some and the humility of all imposed upon
them. If the past is the story of an oppressed race, the
future will reveal that of one uprisen to great opportuni¬
ties, which they will improve from generation to genera¬
tion, and guard with the same vigilance that they will the
liberties and boundaries of the land.
