History of the Black Phalanx.
high. When we first entered the prison the ration was fair in quantity.
We had from twelve to sixteen ounces of corn-bread, and from two to
four ounces of beef or a cup of pea-soup, but never beef and soup th®
same day. True, the soup would have an abundance of worms floating
about in it, but these we would skim off, and trying to forget we had
seen them, eat with a relish. Hunger will drive one to eat almost any¬
thing, as we learned from bitter experience. About the 1st of November
the fcoup and beef ration began to decrease, and from the middle of the
month to the 20th of February, when I was paroled, not a ration of
meat or soup was issued. Nothing but corn-bread, made from unbolted
meal, and water, and that growing less and less. Sometimes I would
divide my ration into three parts and resolve to make it last all day, but
invariably it would be gone before noon, Generally I would eat the
whole ration at once, but that did not satisfy my hunger, and I had to
go without a crumb for the nfext twenty-four hours. To illustrate how
inadequate the ration was, I can say that I have seen officers picking
potato-peelings from the large spittoons, where they were soaking in to¬
bacco spittle, wash them off and eat them.
"'We had an abundance of good, pure water, which was a great
blessing. Pails were furnished, and when five or six men were ready, the
sentry would call the corporal of the guard, who would send a guard of
from four to six with us to the river, about two hundred yards distant.
Twice a day an officer would come in and call the roll; that is form us
into four ranks and count the files. If any had escaped, it was essential
that the number should be kept good for some days, to enable them to
get a good start, and for this purpose various means were used. Some,
times one of the rear rank, after being counted, would glide along unseen
to the left of the line and be recounted. A hole was cut in the upper
floor, and while the officer was going up stairs, some would climb through
the hole and be counted with those on the third floor. This created some
confusion, as the number would occasionally overrun.
"As the season advanced we suffered more and more from the cold,
for "being captured in September our clothing was not sufficient for De¬
cember and January. Yery few had blankets, and the rebel authorities
never issued either blankets or clothing of any kind. The windows of
the lower rooms were without glass, and only the lower half of each
boarded up; the wind would whistle through the large openings, and
drawing up through the open floor, upon which we had to lie at night,
would almost freeze us. I finally succeeded in trading my watch with
one of the guard for an old bed-quilt and twenty dollars Confederate
money. The money came in very good time, for I then had the scurvy
so badly that my tongue, lips and gums were so swollen that by evening
I could scarcely speak. In the morning the swelling would not be quite
so bad, and by soaking the corn-bread in water, could manage to swal¬
low a little. The surgeon, who visited the prison every day, cauterized
my mouth, but it continued to grow worse, until at last I could not eat
the coarse bread. Sometimes I would have a chance to sell it for from
