after breakfast. Picket-firing continued during the day and heavy ar¬
tillery firing was heard in the direction *of Petersburg. At 4 p. m. a flag
of truce was sent out and two hours given to bring in the dead from
between the lines. Gen. Chambliss' body was delivered, and we received
that of Capt. Williams, of the Thirty-ninth Illinois. Early in the even¬
ing the regiment was ordered on picket. Considerable picket-firmg oc¬
curred during the night and day, the men being with difficulty restrained
from it. "We were relieved about noon of the 18th by the One Hundred
and Fifteenth New York and Seventy-sixth Pennsylvania. * * *
"Early in the morning the Eighth and the Twenty-ninth Connecti¬
cut rejoined the regiment, and after the regiment was relieved from
picket, it, with the Twenty-ninth, fell back a quarter of a mile, leav¬
ing the Eighth and Ninth on the line. Eations having been drawn, the
men got supper and prepared for a good night's sleep. Suddenly a
heavy musketry fire broke out toward the left 'which rapidly extended
to the right and the entire line was soon under fire. The regiment
moved forward at double-quick, but by the time it reached the front
and formed line, darkness set in and the enemy fell back. About H
p. m. our forces were withdrawn, and, after several hours spent in march-
ing and halting, the regiment went into camp two miles from the
pontoons. Here it lay all day of the 19th. The following congratula¬
tory order was received from corps headquarters, in which the brigade
was spoken of in very flattering terms by Maj.-Gen. D. B. Birney, com¬
manding:
"' Headquarters Tenth Army Corps, \
Fuzzel'b Mills, Va., August 19, 1S64./
General Orders.—The Major-General commanding congratulates
the Tenth Army Corps upon its success. It has, on each occasion, when
ordered, broken the enemy's strong lines. It has captured during this
short campaign four seige guns protected by formidable works, six
colors and many prisoners. It has proved itself worthy of its old Wag¬
ner and Fort Sumter renown.
" 'Much fatigue, patience and heroism, may still be demanded of it,
but the Major-General commanding is confident of the response. To
the colored troops, recently added to us, and fighting with us, the
Major-General tenders his thanks for their uniform good conduct and
soldierly bearing. They have set a good example to our veterans, by
the entire absence of straggling from their ranks on the march.
"'By order of Maj.-Gen. I). B. Birney.
"'E.W.SMITH,
Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.'
" The special correspondent of the New York Tribune said:
"' Gen. Butler, in a dispatch to the Tenth Corps, on receiving official
report of its work, said: 'All honor to the brave Tenth Corps; you
have done more than was expected of you by the Lieutenant-General.'
"'The loss in the four colored regiments is about three hundred.
The Seventh IT. S. C. T. on the first day, carried, with fixed bayonets, a
line of rifle-pits, and carried it without a shot., but with a loss of 35.
It was one of the most stirring and gallant affairs I have ever known'.
