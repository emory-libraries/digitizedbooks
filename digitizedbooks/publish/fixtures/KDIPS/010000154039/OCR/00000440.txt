438 History of the Black Phalanx.
Wagner found how strong it was he halted his line and remained in ad¬
vance as skirmishers. As the regiment was forming for the charge,
behind the crest of a knoll, Capt. Bailey, Gen. Birney's Adjutant-Gen¬
eral, rode up to Col. Shaw with the order to send four companies de¬
ployed as skirmishers to ' attack and take the work that is firing.' Col.
Shaw replied that he had orders to charge it with his regiment, to which
Capt. Bailey answered, ' well, now the General directs you to send four
companies, deployed as skirmishers, to take the work.' Lieut.-Col. Has¬
kell, being absent on leave, and Maj. Mayer sick, companies C, D, G and
K were placed under command of Capt. Weiss, who, when he received
the order to charge, replied, 'what! take a fort with a skirmish line?'
and then added, ' I will try, but it can't be done.' What followed can
best be described by quoting his own words:
"Captain Weiss says: 'I at once, about 1 p. m., ordered the four
companies on the right of the regiment, C, D, G and K, twenty-five or
thirty paces to the front, where a slight depression ih the ground se¬
cured them from the eyes, if not the projectiles, of the enemy. After
being deployed by the flank on the right of the second company from
the right, the command advanced in ordinary quick step against the
objective point. Emerging from the swale into view, it became at once
the target for a seemingly redoubled fire, not only from the fort in front,
but also from the one on its right. The fire of the latter had been
reported silenced, but instead, from its position to the left oblique, it
proved even more destructive than that of the one in front.
"' Both forts were most advantageously situated for defense, at the
extremity of a plain, variously estimated at from 500 to 700 yards
wide, whose dead level surface afforded at no point shelter from view or
shot to an assailing party. Tne forts were connected by a curtain of
rifle-pits containing a re-entrant angle, thus providing for a reciprocal
enfilading fire in case either was attacked.
"' The nature of the ground and the small altitude of the ordnance
above the level of theplain also made the fire in the nature of a ricochet.
"As the party advanced the enemy's shell and schrapnel were ex¬
changed for grape and cannister, followed soon by a lively rattle of
musketry. When within range of the latter, and after having traversed
about three-fourths of the distance, the order to charge was given and
obeyed with an alacrity that seemed to make the execution almost pre¬
cede the order. For a moment, judging from the slacking of their fire,
the enemy seemed to be affected by a panicky astonishment, but soon
recovering, they opened again with cannister and musketry, which, at
the shorter range, tore through the ranks with deadlier effect. Capt.

In the track of the brigade lay the loyal dead,
Afrie's hecatomb, her lineage's pyre to liberty wea,
Their upturned countenances to the burning sun.
Were appeals* to Mars for their ra.ce's freedom won,
Five hundred lives on the patriotic alter lay,
Following Butler to New Market heights that day.
No marble shaft or granate pile mark the spot
Where they fell—their bones lay harvested from sun-rot,
In the Nation's cities of the dead. Hannibal led
No braver than they through Alpine snow, nor wed
To freedom were Greece's phalanx more, who o'er gory
clay
Followed Butler to New Market heights that day.
