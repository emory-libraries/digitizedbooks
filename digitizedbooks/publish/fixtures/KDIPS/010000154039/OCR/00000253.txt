them in more than one campaign, and upon more than one bloody and
disastrous field.
"By the failure of this attack, it was evident that the guns of "Wagner
must be silenced before a successful assault with infantry dould be made;
and, in order to accomplish this, a siege of greater or less duration was
required. Therefore earthworks were immediately thrown up at the dis¬
tance of about a thousand yards from the fort, and the guns and mor¬
tars from Folly Island brought over to be placed in position.
"This Morris Island is nothing but a narrow bed of sand, about
threo miles in length, with a breadth variable from a few hundred yards
to a few feet. Along the central portion of the lower end a ridge of white
Band hills appear, washed on one side by the tidal waves, and sloping on
the other into broad marshes, more than two miles in width, and inter¬
sected by numerous deep creeks. Upon the extreme northern end, Bat¬
tery Gregg, which the rebels used in reducing Fort Sumter in 1861, had
been strengthened, and mounted with five heavy guns, which threw their
ehot more than half way down the island. A few hundred yards farther
down the island, and at its narrowest portion, a strong fort had been
erected, and armed with seventeen guns and mortars. This was the
famous Fort "Wagner; and, as its cannon prevented any farther progress
up the island, it was necessary to reduce it before our forces could ap¬
proach nearer to Fort Sumter.
"It was thought by our engineers that a continuous bombardment
of a few days by our siege batteries and the fleet might dismount the
rebel cannon, and demoralize the garrison, so that our brave boys, by a
Budden rush, might gain possession of the works. Accordingly our seige
train was brought over from Folly Island, and a parallel commenced
about a thousand yards from "Wagner. Our men worked with such
energy that nearly thirty cannon and mortars were in position on the
17th of July. On the 18th of July the bombardment commenced. The
land batteries poured a tempest of shot into the south side of "Wagner,
while the fleet moved up to within short range, and battered the east
Bide with their great guns. In the mean time the rebels were not silent,
but gallantly stood to their guns, returning shot for shot with great
precision. But, after a few hours, their fire slackened; gun after gun be¬
came silent, as the men were disabled, and, when the clock struck four in
the afternoon, "Wagner no longer responded to the furious cannonade r*
the Federal forces. Even the men had taken shelter beneath the bomb-
proofs, and no sign of life was visible about the grim and battered
fortress.
" Many of our officers were now so elated with the apparent result of
demolition, that they urged General Gillmore to allov them to assault
the fort as soon as it became dark. General Gillmore yielded to the soli-
ictations of the officers, but very reluctantly, for he was not convinced
that tho proper time had arrived; but the order was finally ^iven for the
attack to take place just after dark. Fatal error as to time, for our
troops in the daytime would have been successful, since they would not
