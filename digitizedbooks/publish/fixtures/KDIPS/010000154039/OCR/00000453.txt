army actively engaged; he stopped the exchange of pris¬
oners, invited President Lincoln, then at City Point, to
come out and see the army advance, which he did. He
met Grant in the city of Petersburg, amid the exultations
of the troops and the joyous demonstrations of the negro
population. General Lee made no stop at Richmond; he
had informed Jefferson Davis that he must give up the
city. The latter, with his aids and all the money he could
collect,—not the confederate paper, but the gold of the
United States,—stampeded.
General Weitzel, with Kautz's division of the 24th
Corps and Thomas' and Ashborne's division of the 25th
Corps, on the north side of the James river, lay quietly
upon their arms during the fight on the south side.
Grant kept Weitzel informed as to the results of the at¬
tack, and warned him to be on the alert and take every
advantage offered, to press the confederates. General
Longstreet's forces^ had been in Weitzel's front, but were
partly withdrawn to defend Petersburg; therefore the
latter kept unceasing vigil upon the fortifications before
him.
Sunday evening the bands were ordered out to play,
and it was late into the night when their melodious
strains ceased to float through the air. It was a night
long to be remembered, the hearts of the black soldiers of
the 25th Corps, gladdened by the reports of the victories
of the troops before Petersburg, were jubilant, and with
vigilant watch each looked for morning. They were im¬
patient for the light, and ere it dawned they were ready
for the onset which they believed must come with it. The
enemy whom they supposed were preparing to give them
battle, was silently stealing away to the enchanting
strains of the Federal musicians. It was near the morn¬
ing hours when a sudden report startled the sleeping sol¬
diers ; an explosion, another, and yet another followed in
rapid succession.
General Weitzel soon became satisfied that the enemy
was moving, the continuous sound of distant cannonad¬
ing away to the south, told that the combat still raged.
