squads and hired teachers, paying them out of their pittance of seven
dollars per month, or out of the bounty paid to them by the State to
which they were accredited. In a number of instances the officers them¬
selves gave instructions to their command, and made education a fea¬
ture and a part of their duty, thereby bringing the soldier up to a full
comprehension of the responsibility of his trust. "Taps" was an
unpleasant sound to many a soldier, who, after the fatigue and drill of
the day was over, sat himself down upon an empty cracker box, with a
short candle in one hand and a spelling book in the other, to study the
ab, eb, ob's. When the truce was sounded after a day or night's hard
fighting, many of these men renewed their courage by studying and
reading in the ' New England Speller.' And where they have fought,—
died where they fell, and their bodies lefb to the enemy's mercy, they
often found in the dead soldier's knapsack a spelling-book and a Testa¬
ment. At the seige of Port Hudson and Charleston, and of Richmond,
agents of the Christian Commission and of various other societies, made
a specialty of the spelling-book for distribution among the soldiers of
the Phalanx, and upon more than one occasion have these soldiers been
found in the trenches with the speller in hand, muttering, bla, ble.'
The historian of the 55th Begiment says:
"A great desire existed among those who had been deprived of all
educational privileges to learn to read and write, and through the kind¬
ness and labors of Dr. Bowditch and others, a school was established
to teach those who desired to learn. Many availed themselves of this,
and many were assisted by their company officers and their better
informed fellow-soldiers, so that a decided improvement in this respect
was effected among the men during their stay at Readville."
But it is not necessary to dwell upon the subject to
show the eagerness of these soldiers to learn to read and
write, as many of them did.
Lieutenant James M. Trotter,* in an article published
in Mr. Fortune's paper, gives this graphic description of
"The School-master in the Army":
" Of the many interesting experiences that attended our colored sol¬
diery during the late war none are more worthy of being recounted than
those relating to the rather improvised schools, in which were taught
the rudimentary branches. One would naturally think that the tented
field, so often suddenly changed to the bloody field of battle, was the
last place in the world where would be called into requisition the school¬
teacher's services; in fact it would hardly be supposed that such a thing
was possible. Yet in our colored American army this became not only
possible but really practicable, for in it frequently, in an off-hand man¬
ner schools were established and maintained, not only for teaching the
soldiers to read and write but also to sing, nor were debating societies,
