Government, while the patriotic black men continued to
pour out their blood and to give their lives for liberty and
the Union.
The matter being one for Congress to adjust, Henry
Wilson, of Massachusetts, on the 8th of Jan. 1864, intro¬
duced in the Senate of the United States, a bill to promote
enlistments in the army, and in this measure justice to
the black soldiers was proposed. After months of debate,
it was finally passed; not only placing the Phalanx sol¬
diers on a footing with all other troops, but made free,
the mothers, wives and children of the noble black troops.
The fight of the Phalanx for equal pay and allowance
with the white troops, was a long one. The friends of the
black soldiers in Congress fought it, however, to the suc¬
cessful issue. Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, took the
lead in the matter in the Senate, as he did in the amend-
■articles of clothing. If one of the former class is made first sergeant, his pay is put up
to twenty-one dollars per month; but if he escaped two days later, his pay is still esti¬
mated at seven dollars.
"It had not occurred to me that anything could make the pay-rolls of these regi¬
ments more complicated than at present, or the men more rationally discontented. I
had not the ingenuity to imagine such an order. Yet it is no doubt in accordance with
the spirit, if not with the letter, of the final bill which was adopted by Congress under
the lead of Mr. Thaddeus Stevens.
" The ground taken by Mr. Stevens apparently was that the country might honor¬
ably save a few dollars by docking the promised pay of those colored soldiers whom
the war had made free. But the Government should have thought of this before it
made the contract with these men and received their services. When the War Depart¬
ment instructed Brigadier-General Saxton, August 25, 1862, to raise five regiments of
negroes in South Carolina, it was known very well that the men so enlisted had only
recently gained their freedom. But the instructions said: 'The persons so received
into service, and their officers, to be entitled to and receive the same pay and rations as
are allowed by law to volunteers in the service.' Of this passage Mr. Solicitor Whiting
wrote to me: 'i have no hesitation in saying that the faith of the Government was
thereby pledged to every officer and soldier enlisted under that call.' Where is that
faith of the Government now ?
"The men who enlisted under the pledge were volunteers, every one; they did not
pet their freedom by enlisting; they had it already. They enlisted to serve the Govern¬
ment, trusting in its honor. Now the nation turns upon them and says: Your part of
the contract is fulfilled; we have had your services. If you can show that you had pre¬
viously been free for a certain length of time, we will fulfil the other side of the contract.
If not, we repudiate it. Help yourselves, if you can.
"In other words, a freedman (since April 19,1861) has no rights which a white man
is bound to respect. He is incapable of making a contract. No man is bound by a
contract made with him. Any employer, following the example of the United States
Government, may make with him a written agreement, receive his services, and then
■withhold the wages. He has no motive to honest industry, or to honesty of any kind.
He is virtually a slave, and nothing else, to the end of time.
" Under this order, the greater part of the Massachusetts colored regiments will get
their pay at last, and be able to take their wives and children out of the almshouses,
to which, as Governor Andrew informs us, the gracious charity of the nation has con¬
signed so many. For so much I am grateful. But toward my regiment, which had
been in service and under fire, months before a Northern colored soldier was recruited,
the policy of repudiation has at last been officially adopted. There is no alternative
for the officers of South Carolina regiments but to wait for another session of Congress,
and meanwhile, if necessary, act as executioners for these soldiers who, like Sergeant
Walker, refuse to fulfil their share of a contract where the Government has openly repu¬
diated the other share. If a year's discussion, however, has at length, secured the
arrears of pay for the Northern colored regiments, possibly two years may secure it for
the Southern. T. W. HIGGINSON,
