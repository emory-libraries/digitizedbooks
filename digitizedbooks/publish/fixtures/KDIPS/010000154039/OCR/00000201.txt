■within twenty "miles of yon? And when that is done, and yon have no longer to fear
from these organized forces, and they have returned peaceably to their homes, you
will b& able to use the full power of your troops to insure your safety from the so
much feared (by them, not by you) servile insurrection.
"If you desire, you can send a flag of truce to the commander of these forces, em¬
bracing these views, and placing upon him the responsibility which belongs to him.
Even that course will not remove it from you, for upon you it has never rested. Say to
them, that if all armed opposition to the authority of the United States shall cease in
Louisiana, on the west bank of the river, you are authorized by the commanding gen¬
eral to say, that the same protection against negro or other violence will be afforded
that part of Louisiana that has been in the part already in the possession of the Uni¬
ted States. If that is refused, whatever may ensue is upon them, and not upon you or
upon the United States, "i* ou will have done all that is required of a brave, humane
man, to avert from these deluded people the horrible consequences of their insane war
upon the government. » » » *
" Consider this case. General Bragg is at liberty to ravage the houses of our breth¬
ren of Kentucky because the Union army of Louisiana are protecting his wife and his
home against his negroes. Without that protection he would have to come back to
take care of his wife, his home and his negroes. It is understood that Mrs. Bragg is
one of the terrified mo men of whom you speak in your report.
This subject is not 'for the first time under the consideration of the commanding
general. When in command of the Department of Annapolis, in May, 1861, he was
asked to protect a community against the consequences of a servile insurrection. He
replied, that when that community laid down its arms, and called upon him for pro¬
tection, he would give it, because from that moment between them and him war would
cease. The same principle initiated there will govern his and your actions now; and
you will afford such protection as soon as the community through its organized
rulers shall ask it.
" » # # » jn the mean time, these colored regiments of free men, raised by the
authority of the president, and approved by him as the commander-in-chief of the
army, must be commanded by the officers of the army of the United States, like any
other regiment."
General Butler continued General Weitzel in command
but placed the negroes under another officer. However,
General Weitzel, like thousands of others, changed his
mind in regard to the colored troops. "If he was not con¬
vinced by General Butler's reasoning/' says Parton, "he
must have been convinced by what he saw of the conduct
of those very colored regiments at Port Hudson, where he
himself gave such a glorious example of prudence and
gallantry."
Notwithstanding these troops did good service, it did
not soften or remove very much of the prejudice at the
North against the negro soldiers, nor in the ranks of the
army. Many incidents might be cited to show the feeling
of bitterness against them.* However, General Butler's
example was followed very soon by every officer in com¬
mand, and by the time the President's Emancipation
Proclamation was issued there were not less than 10,000
negroes armed and equipped along the Mississippi river.
Of course the Government knew nothing of this.(?) Not
" • In November, while the 2nd Regiment was guardingthe Opelousas railway, about
twentv miles from Algiers, La., their pickets were fired upon, and quite a skirmish and
firing was kept up during the night. Next morning the cane field along the railroad
wns searched but no trace of the firing party was found. A company of the 8th Ver¬
mont (white} Regiment was encamped below that of the 2nd Regiment, but they broke
canm that, night and left. The supposition was that it was this company who fired
upon and drove in the pickets of the Phalanx regiment.
