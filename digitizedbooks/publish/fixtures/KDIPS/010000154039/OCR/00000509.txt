The Black Phalanx at School.

successful school-teacher. Preaching had been his vocation before
entering the army, and so it was but natural for him to continue in that
work. At one time our regiment lay encamped near his in South Caro¬
lina, and I well remember how, on one Sabbath morning, the two com¬
mands formed a union service, all listening with deep, thrilling interest
to the inspiring words of this " fighting parson." That he was indeed a
fighting parson we fully learned not long after this Sabbath service.
For again we met on the bloody field of battle, where in the very front
of the fight we saw him gallantly leading his no less gallant men, even
after he had been wounded, and while the blood almost streamed down
his face. Seeing him thus was to ever remember him and his noble work
with his regiment.
" Colonel Beecher when encamped neglected no opportunity to form
schools of instruction for his men, in order that they might become not
only intelligent, efficient soldiers, but also intelligent, self-respecting citi¬
zens, should they survive the perils of war. I do not know what are his
thoughts to-day, but judging from the grand work of Colonel Beecher in
his black regiment, I can not doubt that he looks back to it all with
satisfaction and pride, and as forming the richest experience of his life.
" I know another ex-colonel and scholar, of high rank as a man of
letters and in social life, who yielding to the call of duty, not less to
country than to a struggling race, left his congenial studies and took
command of a colored regiment, becoming not only their leader, but, as
chance afforded, their school-teacher also. However, as he has given to
the world his army experience in a book abounding in passages of thrill¬
ing dramatic interest, I need only in this connection make mention of
him. I refer to that true and tried friend of the colored race, Colonel
T. W. Higginson.
" But let it not be supposed for a moment that only officers and men
of another race were engaged in this noble work of school-teaching in
our colored army. Not a few of the best workers were colored chaplains,
who wisely divided their time between preaching, administering to the
sick by reason of wounds or otherwise, and to teaching the old 'young
idea how to shoot;' while many non-commissioned officers and private
soldiers cheerfully rendered effective service in the same direction. Nor
must we close without expressing warm admiration for those earnest,
ambitious soldier pupils who, when finding themselves grown to man's
estate, having been debarred by the terrible system of slavery from
securing an education, yielded not to what would have been considered
only a natural discouragement, but, instead, followed the advice and
instruction of their comrade teachers, and, bending themselves to most
assiduous study, gained in some cases great proficiency, and in all much
that fitted them for usefulness and the proper enjoyment of their well-
earned liberty. And so we say, all honor to teachers and taught in the
Grand Army that made a free republic, whose safe foundation and
perpetuity lies in the general education of its citizens."
