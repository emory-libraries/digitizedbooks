pedition, forming a part of Colonel Williams' Brigade of
General Thayer's Division. Major-General Steele's forces
left Little Rock about tlie same time that General
Thayer's Division left Fort Smith, the latter uniting with
the former on the Little Missouri river, all destined for
active operations in the direction of Red River.
Colonel Crawford, in reply to the writer's circular letter
asking for information respecting the 2nd Regiment's ser¬
vice on the frontier, thus pungently details the operations
of the army of which his regiment was a part:
"Washington, D. C., Dec. 31st., 1885.
"Joseph T. Wilson, Esq., Richmond, Va.
"My Dear Sib:

"The Second Kansas, afterwards designated as the 83rd United States Colored
Troops, was organized at Fort Scott, Kansas, on the 3rd day of October, 1863. Most
of the companies were organized and mustered into service during the spring and sum¬
mer preceeding. The regiment, when organized, was full to the maximum, or nearly so,
and composed of active, able-bodied young men. Immediately upon assuming com¬
mand of the regiment, I moved to the front through Missouri, to Fort Smith, in Ar¬
kansas, where the regiment was stationed during the winter 1863-4, and when not on
other duty or in the field, spent the time in company and regimental drill.
" On the 24th day of March, 1864, with the Kansas Division of the Frontier Army
under the command of General Thayer, I moved south and joined the 7th Army Corps-
under the command of Major-General Fred. Steele, in an expedition against the rebel
armies under-Generals Price, Kirby Smith and Dick Taylor, then encamped in the vicin¬
ity of Shreveport, La.
" While Steele was advancing from the North, General Banks was at the same time
moving up the Bed river from the East. Price, Smith and Taylor, seeing the two
armies of Steele and Banks, closing in upon them, concentrated their forces, first upon
Banks, and after defeating and routing his forces, turned upon Steele, who was then
near Red riv^r, in south-western Arkansas.
Steele hearing of the Banks disaster, changed his course and moved eastward, to
Camden, a strongly fortified town on the Washita river. From the point at which he
turned eastward, to Camden, a distance of about sixty miles, the march was almost
continuous, except when it became necessary to skirmish with the enemy's cavalry,
which hovered unpleasantly close during the greater part of the distance.
" In each of the light engagements which took place on this march from Red river
to Camden, the 2nd .Regiment participated, and behaved in a manner creditable to it¬
self and the army*
" After remaining at Camden about three days (so as to give the victorious rebel
armies full time to concentrate upon him) General Steele crossed the Washita to the'
North and commenced a disgraceful retreat or run back toward Little Rock.
"The enemy, under Price and Kirby Smith, followed in close pursuit, and within a
few hours were again upon our flank and rear. The march or retreat was continuons,
night and day, until the village of Princeton was reached, where Steele's army en¬
camped one night, and received a full ration of fresh beef and New Orleans sugar, the
latter of which had been captured, or rather found in Camden. Early on the following
morning the army resumed its onward march, towards the North Pole as the apparent
objective point.
"Now mind you this was an army (the 7th Army Corps) about thirty thousand
strong; mostly Western troops, and splendidly armed and equipped. Better soldiers
never wore spurs or carried muskets. Yet under the command of a tenor singing dog
fancier, that magnificent army was thus retreating before an army in every way its .in¬
ferior save, and except, the Commanding General.
" Thus things went, disgracefully, until the afternoon of the day on which we left
Princeton, April 2!), 1864. Then, for the first time after turning our backs to the enemy,
in the vicinity of Red river, there seemed to be a bare possibility of escape,—not from
the enemv, but from absolute disgrace and humiliation.
"At no time during that disgraceful retreat, was there a moment when the whole
army corps, except the Commanding General, would not have welcomed a battle, with
one universal shout. . ,,, , , „
" About 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the day mentioned, the rebel Cavalry ap¬
peared in force and commenced skirmishing with our forces in the rear, which continued,
more or less, until darkness set in. Meantime our distinguished leader, the Major-Gen¬
eral Commanding, had arrived at the crossing of the Saline river, thrown a pontoon
bridge over that swollen stream, and made good his escape to the north side, taking
