History of the Black Phalanx.
The news of the battle and defeat reached Beaufort
the night of the 23rd of February. It was so surprising
that it was doubted, but when a boat load of wrounded
men arrived, all doubts were dispelled.
Colonel T. W. Higginson, who was at Beaufort at the
time with his regiment, (1st S. C.), thus notes the recep¬
tion of the news in his diary, which we quote with a few
comments from his admirable book, "Army Life in a
Black Kegiment":
"' February, 19th.
"' Not a bit of it! This morning the General has ridden up radiant,
nas seen General Gillmore, who has decided not to order us to Florida at
all, nor withdraw any of this garrison. Moreover, he says that all
which is intended in Florida is done—that there will be no advance to
Tallahassee, and General Seymour will establish a camp of instruction
in Jacksonville. Well, if that is all, it is a lucky escape.'
"We little dreamed that on that very day the march toward Olustee
was beginning. The battle took place next day, and I add one mort
extract to show how the news reached Beaufort.
"" February 23,1864.
'"There was a sound of revelry by night at a ball in Beaufort last
night, in a new large building beautifully decorated. All the collected
flags of the garrison hung round and over us, as if the stars and stripes
were devised for an ornament alone. The array of uniforms was such,
that a civilian became a distinguished object, much more a lady. Al]
would have gone according to the proverbial marriage bell, I suppose,
had there not been a slight palpable shadow over all of us from hearing
vague stories of a lost battle in Florida, and from the thought that per*
haps the very ambulances in which we rode to the ball were ours only
until the wounded or the dead might tenant them.
"'General Gillmore only came, I supposed, to put a good face upon
the matter. He went away soon, and General Saxton went; then came
a rumor that the Cosmopolitan had actually arrived with wounded,
but still the dance went on. There was nothing unfeeling about it-
one gets used to things,—when suddenly, in the midst of the 'Lan¬
cers,' there came a perfect hush, the music ceasing, a few surgeons went
hastily to and fro, as if conscience stricken (I should think they might
have been)-,—and then there 'waved a mighty shadow in,' as in Uhland'a
'Black Knight,' and as we all stood wondering we were aware of General
Saxton who strode hastily down the hall, his pale face very resolute,
and looking almost sick with anxiety. He had just been on board the
steamer; there were two hundred and fifty wounded men just arrived,
and the ball must end. Not that there was anything for us to do, but
the revel was mis-timed, and must be ended; it was wicked to be
with such a scene of suffering near by.
