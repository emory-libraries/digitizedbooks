"The next day Colonel Johnson reached Nashville, reporting that
when stopped, he and his men were forced, under heavy fire, to abandon
the train, clamber down from the bridge, and run to a blockhouse near
by, which had been erected for the defence of the bridge, and was still in
possession of the Union soldiers. After maintaining a stubborn fight
until far into the night, he withdrew his troops, and making a detour to
the east came into our lines, having lost in killed, wounded and missing,
two officers and eighty men of the 44th, and twenty-five men of the 14th.
"Just as Captain C. W. Baker, the senior officer of the 14th, was
leaving the car, a piece of shell carried off the top of his cap, thus add¬
ing immensely to its value—as a souvenir. Some of the soldiers who
escaped lost everything except the clothes they had on, including knap¬
sacks, blankets and arms. In some cases they lay |in the water hiding
for hours, until they could escape their pursuers.
"Soon after taking our position in line at Nashville, we were closely
beseiged by Hood's army; and thus we lay facing each other for two
weeks. Hood had suffered so terribly by his defeat under Schofield, at
Franklin, that he was in no mood to assault us in our works, and
Thomas needed more time to concentrate and reorganize his army, be¬
fore he could safely take the offensive. That fortnight interval was me¬
morable indeed. Hood's army was desperate. It had been thwarted by
Sherman, and thus far baffled by, Thomas, and Hood felt that he must
strike a bold blow to compensate for the dreadful loss of prestige occa¬
sioned by Sherman's march to the sea. His men were scantily clothed
and poorly fed; if he could gain Nashville, our great depot of supplies,
he could furnish his troops with abundance of food, clothing and war
material; encourage the confederacy, terrify the people of the North, re¬
gain a vast territory taken from the South at such great cost to us, re¬
cruit his army from Kentucky, and perhaps invade the North.
" Thomas well knew the gravity of the situation, and was unwilling
to hazard all by a premature battle. I think that neither he nor any of
his army ever doubted the issue of the battle when it should come,
whichever force should take the initiative.
" The authorities at Washington grew restive, and the people at the
North nervous. Thomas was ordered to fight, Logan was dispatched to
relieve him if he did not, and Grant himself started West to take com¬
mand. Thomas was too good a soldier to be forced to offer battle, un¬
til he was sure of victory. He knew that time was his best ally, every
day adding to his strength and weakening his enemy. In the meantime
the weather became intensely cold, and a heavy sleet covered the ground,
rendering it almost impossible for either army to move at all. For a
few days our sufferings were quite severe. We had only shelter tents for
the men, with very little fuel, and many of those who had lost their
blankets keenly felt their need.
" On December 5th, before the sxorm, by order of General Steadman,
I made a little reconnoissance, capturing, with slight loss, Lieutenant
Gardner and six men, from the 5th Mississippi Regiment. December 7th
