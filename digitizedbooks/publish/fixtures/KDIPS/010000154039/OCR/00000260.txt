History of the Black Phalanx.
Tiered pity into the eyes of those who stood pausing to gather strength
to spring upon her, and of those who stood at bay to battle for her
safety. Yet the profound repose was undisturbed; the early hours of that
fair morning hoisted a flag of truce between the combatants which was
respected by both. But the tempest of fire which was destined to break
the charm of nature, with human thunders then unsurpassed in war,
was gathering in the south. At about half-past 7 o'clock the ships of
war moved from their moorings, the iron leviathan the Ironsides, an Aga¬
memnon among ships, leading and directing their movements, then
monitor after monitor, and then wooden flagships. Steadily and majes¬
tically they marched; marched as columns of men would march, obedient
to commands, independent of waves and winds, mobilized by steam and
science to turn on a pivot and manoeuvre as the directing mind required
them; they halted in front of the fort; they did not anchor as Sir Peter
Parker's ships had done near a hundred years before in front of Moultrie,
"which was hard by and frowning still at her ancient enemies of the ocean.
They halted and waited for word of command to belch their consuming
lightnings ©ut upon the foe. On the land, engineering skill was satisfied
and the deadly exposure for details for labor was ended; the time for
retaliation had arrived when the defiant shots of the rebel batteries
would be answered; the batteries were unmasked; the cordon of fire was
complete by land and by sea; the doomed fort was encircled by guns.
" The Confederates watched from the ramparts the approach of the
fleet and the unmasking of the guns, and they knew that the moment
had arrived in which the problem of the capacity of the resistant power
of earth and sand to the forces to which science so far developed in war
could subject them was to be solved and that Battery Wagner was to be
that day the subject of the crucial test. The small armament of the fort
was really inappreciable in the contest about to be inaugurated. There
was but one gun which could be expected to be of much avail against
the formidable naval power which would assail it and on the land side
few which could reach the enemy's batteries. "When these guns were
knocked to pieces and silenced there was nothing left but passive resis¬
tance, but the Confederates, from the preliminary tests which had been
applied, had considerable faith in the capacity of sand and earth for pas¬
sive resistance.
"The fort was in good condition, having been materially strength¬
ened since the former assault by the indefatigable exertions of Colonel
David Harris, chief engineer, and his valuable assistant, Captain Barn¬
well. Col©nel Harris was a Yirginian, ex-officer of the army of the Uni¬
ted States and a graduate of West Point, who had some years before
retired from the service to prosecute the profession of civil engineering.
Under a tempest of shells he landed during the fiercest period of the bom¬
bardment at Cummings' Point, and made his way through the field of
fire to the beleaguered fort to inspect its condition and to inspire the gar¬
rison by his heroic courage and his confidence in its strength. Escaping
all the dangers of war, he fell a victim to yellow fever in Charleston, be-
