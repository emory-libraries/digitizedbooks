two years before even the door of the partition was
opened; then he did not hesitate, but walked in, and with
what effect the world knows.
The war cloud of 1860 still more aroused the bitter
prejudice against the negro at both the North and South;
but he was safer in South Carolina than in New York, in
Richmond than in Boston.
It is a natural consequence, when war is waged be¬
tween two nations, for those on either side to forget local
feuds and unite against the common enemy, as was done
in the Revolutionary war. How different was the situa¬
tion now when the threatened war was not one between
nations, but between states of the same nation. The feel¬
ing of hostility toward the negro was not put aside and
forgotten as other troublesome matters were, but the bit¬
terness became intensified and more marked.
The Confederate Government though organized for
the perpetual enslavement of the negro, fostered the idea
that the docility of the negroes would allow them to be
used for any purpose, without their having the least idea
of becoming freemen. Some idea may be formed of pub¬
lic opinion at the South at the beginning of the war by
what Mr. Pollard, in his history, gives as the feeling at the
South at the close of the second year of the struggle:
"Indeed, the war had shown the system of slavery in the South to
the world in some new and striking aspects, and had removed much of
that cloud of prejudice, defamation, falsehood, romance and perverse
sentimentalism through which our peculiar institution had been formerly
known to Europe. It had given a better vindication of our system of
slavery than all the books that could be written in a generation. It had
shown that slavery was an element of strength to us; that it had
assisted us in our struggle; that no servile insurrections had taken place
in the South, in spite of the allurements of our enemy; that the slave
had tilled the soil while his master had fought; that in large districts,
unprotected by our troops, and with a white population, consisting
almost exclusively of women and children, the slave had continued his
work, quiet, faithful, and cheerful; and that, as a conservative element
in our social system, the institution of slavery had withstood the shocks
of war, and been a faithful ally of our army, although instigated to
revolution by every art of the enemy, and prompted to the work of
assassination and pillage by the most brutal examples of the Yankee
soldiers."
