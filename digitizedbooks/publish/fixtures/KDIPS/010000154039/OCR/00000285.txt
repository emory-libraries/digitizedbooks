black ones, but do not work as constantly. Black soldiers seldom inter¬
mit their labors except by orders or permission. The result, as far as
my observations extends, is that a greater amount of work is usually
accomplished with black than with whit£ soldiers.
"IV. 'If a certain work were to be accomplished in the least possi¬
ble time, when enthusiasm and direct personal interest is necessary to
the attainment of the end, would whites or blacks answer best?'
"Whites. Because though requiring more effort to control, they
possess a greater energy of character and susceptibility of enthusiasm
than the black race, which can be called into action by an emergency or
by a sufficient effort on the part of their officers.
"V. 'What is the difference, considering the above points, between
colored troops recruited from the free States and those from the slave
States?'
"I have observed a decided difference in favor of those recruited from
the free States.
" The problem involved in the foregoing investigation is more diffi¬
cult of a solution than appears at first sight, owing to the fact that the
degree of efficiency peculiar to any company of troops depends so much
on the character of their officers, an element that must eliminate from
the question in order to ascertain the quality of the material of which
the troops are composed.

"1st Lieut. New York Volunteer Engineers.'"
In his report to Major-General Gillmore, dated "Mor¬
ris Island, Sept. 27th, 1863," Major Brooks, his Assistant
Engineer, says: "Of the numerous infantry regiments
which furnished fatigue details, the Fourth New Hamp¬
shire Volunteers did the most and best work. Next follow
the blacks, the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers,
and Third United States Colored Troops."
Annexed to these reports is also a statement of the
labor days of the troops.
"WORKING PARTIES AND HEALTH OF TROOPS.
'The total number of days' work, of six hours each, expended in
Major Brooks' operations was, by engineers, 4.500, and by infantry
19,000, total 23,500; of the 19,000 days' work by infantry, one-half
was performed by colored troops. In addition to the above, 9,500 days'
work was expended in preparing siege materials for Major Brooks' oper
ations. The infantry soldiers' days' work is about one-fifth what a
citizen laborer would do on civil works. Of my work, over eight-twen¬
tieths was against Wagner, about seven-twentieths on the defensive
lines, and nearly five-twentieths on the batteries against Sumter.
