History of the Black Phalanx.
" The approximate amount of labor actually expended on the more
important works is as follows: One emplacement for a siege piece, 40
days; one emplacement for a heavy breaching gun, 100 days; one bomb¬
proof magazine, 250 days; construction and repairs of each yard of
approach having splinter-proof parapet, 2 days; a lineal yard of narrow
splinter-proof shelter, 4 days; a lineal yard of wide splinter-proof shelter,
8 days; to make and set one yard of inclined palisading, 2 days.
"At least three-fourths of the manual labor was simply shoveling
sand; one-half of the remainder was carrying engineer material. The
balance was employed in various kinds of work.
"About three-fourths of this work was executed in the night-time,
and at least nine-tenths of it under a fire of artillery or sharpshooters,
or both. The sharp-shooters seldom fired during the night. The artil¬
lery fire was most severe during the day. Thrity-five projectiles fired by
the enemy at our works per hour was called "heavy firing," although
sometimes more than double that number were thrown.
" In the order of their number the projectiles were from smooth-bore
guns, mortars, and rifled guns.
"The James Island batteries were from two thousand to four thou¬
sand yards from our works; Fort Sumter and Battery Gregg were re¬
spectively about three thousand five hundred and two thousand one
hundred; Fort Wagner was from thirteen hundred to one hundred yards.
"The total number of casualties in the working parties and the
guard of the advanced trenches, (not including the main guard of the
trenches), during the siege, was about one hundred and fifty. When it is
considered that on an average over two hundred men were constantly
engaged in these duties, being under fire for fifty days, the number of
casualties is astonishingly small.
" The camp at which the fatigue parties were quartered and fed were,
in order to be beyond the reach of the enemy's fires, two miles from the
centre of the works; hence the distance of four miles had to be marched
each tour of duty, which required nearly two hours, and added greatly
to the labor of the siege.
" This siege has been conducted through the hottest part of the sea¬
son,—July, August and September,—yet the troops have suffered but
little from excess in heat, on account of the large proportion of night
work, and the almost continual sea-breeze, which was always cool and
refreshing.
" The amount of sickness was great, the large amount of duty being
the probable cause. On the 7th of August the percentage was the small¬
est observed during the siege, being 18.6. At this date the aggregate
garrison of Morris Island was 9,353, of which 1,741 were sick. On the
17th of August 22.9 per cent, of the whole garrison were on the sick list.
This was the most unhealthy period of the siege.
" The average strength of the command on Morris Island during the
siege was, of all arms, 10,678 men, of which the average percentage sick
was 19.88. The number of black troops varied from 1,127 to 1947.
