secured. He never forgot this circumstance, and ever took special pains
to show kindness and hospitality to any individual of the colored race,
who came near his dwelling."
The Committee of Safety having excluded slaves from
the army, many were thereafter manumitted, that they
might enlist. There was no law regulating enlistment in
the army at the time which required the color of a soldier's
skin to be recorded or regarded. A prejudice existed in
the legislature that prompted that body to begin a series
of special enactments, regarding negroes, which did not
exclude them altogether from the army, but looked to
their organization into exclusive companies, batallions
and regiments.
Notwithstanding the record made by the negroes who
had swollen the ranks of the American army a few weeks

This was in July, and on the 26th of the following
September, Edward Rutledge, of South Carolina, moved in
the Colonial Congress that all negroes be discharged that
were in the army. As might be expected, his proposition
was strongly supported by the Southern delegates, but
the Northern delegates being so .much stronger, voted it
down. The negroes were crowding so rapidly into the
army, and the Northern colonists finding their Southern
comrades so strongly opposing this element of strength,

committee in October, composed of such men as Dr.
