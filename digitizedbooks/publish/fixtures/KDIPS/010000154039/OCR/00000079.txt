The War of 1812.
77
"Your committee, believing that the freeborn sons of America are
worthy to enjoy the liberty which their fathers purchased at the price of
much blood and treasure, and seeing by the measures adopted by Great
Britain, a course commenced and persisted in, which might lead to a loss
of national character and independence, feel no hesitation in advising
resistence by force, in which the Americans of the present day will prove
to the enemy and the world, that we have not only inherited that liberty
which our fathers gave us, but also the will and power to maintain it.
Relying on the patriotism of the nation, and confidently trusting that
the Lord of Hosts will go with us to battle in a righteous cause, and
crown our efforts with success, your committee recommend an immedi¬
ate appeal to arms."
War was declared by Congress on the 17th of June,
and proclaimed by the President on the second day fol¬
lowing.
The struggle was principally carried on upon the
water, between the armed vessels of the two nations, con¬
sequently no great armies were called into active service
upon the field. This was indeed fortunate for America,
whose military establishments at the time were very defec¬
tive. Congress called for twenty thousand men, but a very

affairs was no doubt largely due to the opposition to the
war, which existed in the New England States.
Since the peace of 1783, a class of marine merchants
at the North had vied with each other in the African slave
trade, in supplying the Southern planters. Consequently
the increase in negro population was great; in 1800 it was
1,001,463, and in 1810, two years before war was de¬
clared, 1,377,810, an increase of 376,347. Of the 1,377,-
810, there were 1,181,362 slaves, and 186,448 free. Of
course their increase was not due solely to the importa¬
tion by the slave trade, but the aggregate increase was
large, compared with the increase of the white pooulation
for the same period.
The free negroes were mainly residents of the Northern
States, where they enjoyed a nominal freedom. They
