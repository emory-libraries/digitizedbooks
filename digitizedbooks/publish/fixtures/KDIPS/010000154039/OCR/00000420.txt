History of the Black Phalanx.
Dinwiddie. If White's Division had occupied Reservoir Hill, Richmond
would have been evacuated/'
But let the writer of the following tell what the brave
black men met after having advanced beyond the crater,
where they grappled with the sullen foe filled with the
recollection of the capture, in June, of their works, guns
and comrades by the " niggers" of the 18th Corps. It was
not lex talionis that they observed, but a repetition of
the Fort Pillow Massacre. Under the head of " The Con¬
federate Charge," the particulars are given:
" The Federals now held the crater and the inner line. Generals Lett
and Mahone arrived on the field about 7:30 a. m. A ravine, which
deepened on our right, ran parallel with this inner line and was used by
Mahone in which to form his brigade when preparing to attack. At 8
a.m. Mahone's Brigade, commanded by Colonel D. A. Weisiger, brought
from the right of Hoke's Division, was formed in this ravine and ad¬
vanced to the assault. The Federals, concentrating a terrific fire of
musketry and artillery, ploughed out great gaps in these fearless Vir¬
ginians. Nothing daunted, they pressed forward and recaptured the
inner line. The loss of this brigade was heavy, both in men and officers,
more than two hundred Virginians falling between the ravine and the
captured works. The Federal troops, white and colored, fought with a
desperation never witnessed on former battle-fields. The negroes, it is
said, cried 'No quarter.' Mahone and Wright's Brigades took only
twenty-nine of them prisoners. The Federals still held the crater and
part of the line. Another charge was necessary and Wright's Georgia
Brigade was ordered up from Anderson's Division. Wright's Brigade,
forming in the ravine, moved forward to drive the Federals from the
line they still held. The enemy, expecting their attack, poured a volley
into the Georgians that decimated their ranks, killing and wounding
nearly every field officer in the brigade. The men rushing forward,
breasting a storm of lead and iron, failed to oblique far enough to the
right to recapture the whole line, but gained the line occupied by and
contiguous to the line already captured by Weisiger, commanding Ma¬
hone's Brigade. Mahone's Brigade and Wright's Brigade had captured
forty-two officers, three hundred and ninety men and twenty-nine
negroes.
" It was now about 10 a. m. General Grant made no effort to rein¬
force his line or to dislodge Wright and Mahone from the positions
they held. A courier dashed up to General J. C. C. Sanders, command¬
ing Wilcox's Brigade, informing him that his brigade was wanted. The
men were expecting this courier, as they were next in Kne, and they dis¬
tinctly heard the shouts of Mahone's and Wright's men, followed by the
heavy artillery firing, while the word had passed down the line that the
