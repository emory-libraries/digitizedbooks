The War of 1775.

question of the American patriots was the theme. And I
find no better eulogy to pronounce upon them than that
Hon. Charles Pinckney, of South Carolina, delivered in
the United States House of Representatives in 1820, and
that of Hon Wm. Eustis, of Massachusetts, during the
same debate. Mr. Pinckney said:
"It is a remarkable fact, that notwithstanding, in t_e course of the
Revolution, the Southern States were continually overrun by the British*
and that every negro in them had an opportunity of leaving their own¬
ers, few did; proving thereby not only a most remarkable attachment to
their owners, but the mildness of the treatment, from whence their affec¬
tion sprang. They then were, as they still are, as valuable a part of our
population to the union as any other equal number of inhabitants.
They were in numerous instances the pioneers, and in all the laborers, of
your armies. To their hands were owing the erection of the greatest
part of the fortifications raised for the protection of our country; some
of which, particularly Fort Moultrie, gave, at the early period of the
inexperience and untried valor of our citizens, immortality to American
arms; and, in the Northern States, numerous bodies of them were en¬
rolled into, and fought, by the side of the whites, the battles of the Kev-
olution."—Annals of Congress.
And said Mr. Eustis:
"At the commmencement of the Revolutionary war, there were found
in the Middle and Northern States, many blacks, and other people of
color, capable of bearing arms; a part of them free, the greater part
slaves. The freemen entered our ranks with the whites. The time of
those who Were slaves was purchased by the States; and they were in¬
duced to enter the servioe in eonsequence of a law by which, on condition
of their serving in the ranks during the war, they were made freemen.
"The war over, and peace restored, these men returned to their
respective States; and who could have said to them, on their return to
civil life, after having shed their blood in common with the whites in the
defence of the liberties of their country, 'You are not to participate in
the liberty for which you have been fighting?' Certainly no white man in
Massachusetts."
Such is the historic story of the negro in the American
Revolution, and it is a sad one as regards any benefit to
his own condition by his connection with either side. But
it is one of the most memorable of all history on exhibi¬
tion of the fidelity of a race to the cause of the freedom of
all men.
