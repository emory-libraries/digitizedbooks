History of the Black Phalanx.
as a reward for gallantry and meritorious service upon
tlie field, or on account of proficiency in drill. This rule of
selection held good throughout all the departments in the
organizing of negro troops. In May, 1863, President
Lincoln, with a view of correcting an abuse that a certain
commanding general had begun to practice in assigning
inferior, though brave, men to the command of negro regi¬
ments ; and in keeping with his new policy of arming the
negroes, for which Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant Gen¬
eral of the Army, had gone into the Mississippi Yalley
region to raise twenty regiments, he appointed a Board
for the examination of those applying for commands in
negro regiments.
The "Record of the 7th Reg't. U.S. Colored Troops," in
regard to the matter, says: "That the labors of this
Board contributed very materially to the success of the
experiment of raising this class of troops, no one cogniz¬
ant with the facts can doubt. The operations of the Board
can best be shown by quoting the following letter received
from Gen. Casey in reply to some enquiries on the subject:
"Brooklyn, Nov. 30th, 1875.
* * * "The Board for the Examination of candidates for officers in
colored regiments, of which I was President, was appointed in May,
1863, and continued its duties about two years. This movement was,
at first, very unpopular with a portion of the people of the country, as
also with a large portion of the army. I, although doubting at first
with regard to the expediency of operating in large bodies with this
species of force, determined, that so far as I was concerned, it should
have a fair trial.
"A system was adopted for the examination of candidates which did
not allow influence, favor or affection to interfere with the enforcement
of its provisions. The Board examined nearly three thousand candi¬
dates, seventeen hundred of whom they recommended for commissions in
various grades, from colonel down.
"From my knowledge of the officers of white volunteers, gained in my
duties connected with receiving and organizing, in the city of Washing¬
ton, 300,000 of them, and also as commander of a division on the
Peninsula, I have no hesitation in saying that the officers of the colored
regiments, who passed the Board, as a body were superior to them,
physically, mentally and morally.
"From the concurrent reports received from various sources, there is
but little doubt that the success of the colored troops in the field was
brought about in no small degree by the action of the Board.
