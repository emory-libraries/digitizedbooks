326 History of the Black Phalanx.
visited; and the testimony they have taken cannot convey to the reader
the impressions which your committee there received. The persons we
saw, as we were assured by those in charge of them, have greatly im¬
proved since they have been received in the hospitals. Yet they are now
dyjng daily, one of them being in the very throes of death as your com¬
mittee stood by his bed-side and witnessed the sad spectacle there pre¬
sented. All those whom your committee examined stated that they have
been thus reduced and emaciated entirely in consequence of the merciless
treatment they received while prisoners from their enemies; and the phy¬
sicians in charge of them, the men best fitted by their profession and ex¬
perience to express an opinion upon the subject, all say that they have
no doubt that the statements of their patients are entirely correct.
"It will be observed from the testimony, that all the witnesses who
testify upon that point state that the treatment they received yvhile con¬
fined at Columbia, South Carolina, Dalton, Georgia, and other places,
was far more humane than that they received at Kichmond, where the
authorities of the so-called confederacy were congregated, and where the
power existed, had the inclination not been wanting, to reform those
a"buses and secure to the prisoners they held some treatment that would
bear a public comparison to that accorded by our authorities to the
prisoners in our custody. Your committee, therefore, are constrained to
say that they can hardly avoid the conclusion, expressed by so many of
our released soldiers, that the inhuman practices herein referred to are
the result of a determination on the part of the rebel authorities to re¬
duce our soldiers in their power, by privation of food and clothing, and
by exposure, to such a condition that those who may survive shall never
recover so as to be able to render any effective service in the field. And
your committee accordingly ask that this report, with the accompany¬
ing testimony be printed with the report and testimony [which was ac¬
cordingly done] in relation to the massacre of Fort Pillow, the one being,
in their opinion, no less than the other, the result of a predetermined
policy. As regards the assertions of some of the rebel newspapers, that
our prisoners have received at their hands the same treatment that their
own soldiers in the field have received, they are evidently but the most
glaring and unblushing falsehoods. No one can for a moment be de¬
ceived by such statements, who will reflect that our soldiers, who, when
taken prisoners, have been stout, healthy men, ia the prime and vigor of
life, yet have died by hundreds under the treatment they have received,
although required to perform no duties of the camp or the march; while
the rebel soldiers are able to make long and rapid marches, and to offer
a stubborn resistance in the field.
"Your committee, finding it impossible to describe in words the de¬
plorable condition of these returned prisoners, have caused photographs
to be taken of a number of them, and a fair sample to be lithographed
and appended to their report, that their exact condition may be known
by all who examine it. Some of them have since died.
"There is one feature connected with this investigation, to which
