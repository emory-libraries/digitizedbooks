So ends the entries on this interesting subject in Mr.
J ones' diary. Though the conscientious war clerk ceased
to record, the excitement and effort of the advocates of
the measure by no means slackened. Grant's cordon
around the city drew closer and tighter each day and hour,
continually alarming the inhabitants. Governor Smith
gave the negro soldier scheme his personal influence and
attention. The newspapers began clamoring for conscrip¬
tion. No little effort was made to raise a regiment of
free blacks and mulattoes in the latter days of January,
and early in February a rendezvous was established at
Kichmond, and a proclamation was issued by the State
authorities. A detail of white officers was made, and
enlistment began. The agitation of the subject in Con¬
gress, though in secret session, gave some encouragement
to the many despairing and heart-sick soldiers of the
Army of Northern Virginia.* Their chief commander, Lee,
perhaps dreamed nightly that he commanded 200,000
negro troops en masse, and was driving the Yankees and
their Black Phalanx like chaff from off the "sacred soil"

Mr. Benjamin, Confederate Secretary of State, were daily
marched into the city and drilled by their white officers in
the Capitol Square, receiving the approving and congratu¬

However, no accessions were gained to their ranks, conse¬
quently the scheme, to raise by enlistment a regiment of
blacks, was a failure, for the few volunteers secured in
Virginia and a company in Tennessee are all that the
writer has been able to obtain any account of. The Con-

Richmond, while some of them are members of the Colored State Militia of Virginia.
+ The veterans of General Henry A. Wise's Legion adopted resolutions commending
the scheme.
t On April 1st, 1865, quite a company of negroes, most of whom were pressed into
the service, paraded the streets of Kichmond.
