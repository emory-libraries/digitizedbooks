the docility of the negro, than upon the audacity of their

The legislature of Tennessee, which secretly placed
that State in the Southern Confederacy, enacted in June,
1861, a law authorizing the governor—
"To receive into the military service of the State all male free per¬

the channel of war. The negro who boasted the loudest
of his desire to fight the Yankees; who showed the great¬
