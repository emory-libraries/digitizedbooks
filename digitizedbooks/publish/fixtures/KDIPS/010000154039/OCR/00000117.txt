enemies, as the worst of enemies, and avail yourselves like men of every
power which God has placed in your hands to accomplish your purpose
within the rilles of civilized warfare." Mr. Rice, (warDem.) ofMinnesota,
declared that "not many days can pass before the people of the United
States North must decide upon one of two questions: we have either to
acknowledge the Southern Confederacy as a free and independent nation,
and that speedily; or we have as speedily to resolve to use all the means
given us by the Almighty to prosecute this war to a successful termina¬
tion. The necessity for action has arisen. To hesitate is worse than
criminal. Mr. Wilson said, " The senator from Delaware, as he is accus¬
tomed to do, speaks boldly and decidedly against the proposition. He
asks if American soldiers will fight if we organize colored men for mili¬
tary purposes. Did not American soldiers fight at Bunker Hill with
negroes in the ranks, one of whom shot down Major Pitcairn as he
mounted the works ? Did not American soldiers fight at Red Bank with
a black regiment from your own State, sir? (Mr. Anthony in the chair.)
Did they not fight on the battle-field of Rhode Island with that black
regiment, one of the best and bravest that ever trod the soil of this con¬
tinent? Did not American soldiers fight at Fort Griswold with black
men ? Did they not fight with black men in almost every battle-field of
the Revolution? Did not the men of Kentucky and Tennessee, standing
on the lines of New Orleans, under the eye of Andrew Jackson, fight
with colored battalions whom he had summoned to the field, and whom
he thanked publicly for their gallantry in hurling back a British foe? It
is all talk, idle talk, to say that the volunteers who are fighting the bat¬
tles of this country are governed by any such narrow prejudice or
bigotry. These prejudices are the results of the teachings of dema¬
gogues and politicians, who have for years undertaken to delude and
deceive the American people, and to demean and degrade them."
Mr. Grimes had expressed his views a few weeks before, and desired a
vote separately on each of these sections. Mr. Davis declared that he
was utterly opposed, and should ever be opposed, to placing arms in the
hands of negroes, and putting them into the army. Mr. Rice wished "to
know if Gen. Washington did not put arms into the hands of negroes,
and if Gen. Jackson did not, and if the senator has ever condemned
either of those patriots for doing so." "I deny," replied Mr. Davis,
"that, in the Revolutionary War, there ever was any considerable
organization of negroes. I deny, that, in the war of 1812, there was
ever any organization of negro slaves. * * * In my own State, I
have no doubt that there are from eighty to a hundred thousand slaves
that belong to disloyal men. You propose to place arms in the hands of
the men and boys, or such of them as are able to handle arms, and to
manumit the whole mass, men, women, and children, and leave them
among us. Do you expect us to give our sanction and our approval to
these things? No, no! We would regard their authors as our worst
enemies; and there is no foreign despotism that could come to our rescue,
that we would not joyously embrace, before we would submit to any
