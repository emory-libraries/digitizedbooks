that no single act of those patriots is in keeping with the
Englishman's prediction; no taint of brutality is even
charged against them by those whom they took prison¬
ers in battle. The confederates themselves testify to the
humane treatment ^hey unexpectedly received at the
hands of their negro captors. Mr. Pollard, the historian,
says:
"No servile insurrections had taken place in the South."
But it is gratifying to know that all Englishmen did
not agree with the writer of the Times. A London letter
in the New York Evening Post, said:
" Mr. Spurgeon makes most effective and touching prayers, remem¬
bering, at least once on a Sunday, the United States. ' Grant, O God,'
he said recently, 'that the right may conquer, and that if the fearful
canker of slavery must be cut out by the sword, it be wholly eradicated
from the body politic of which it is the curse.' He is seldom, however,
as pointed as this; and, like other clergymen of England, prays for the
return of peace. Indeed, it must be acknowledged that if the English
press and government have done what they could to continue this war,
the dissenting clergy of England have nobly shown their good will and
hearty sympathy with the Americans, and their sincere desire for the
settlement of our difficulties. 'If praying would do you Americans any
good,' said an irreverent acquaintance last Sunday, 'you will be grati¬
fied to learn that a force of a thousand-clergymen-power is constantly
at work for you over here.'"
After the heroic and bloody effort at Cold Harbor to
reach Richmond, or to cross the James above the confed¬
erate capitol, and thus cut off the enemy's supplies,—after
Grant had flanked, until to flank again would be to leave
Richmond in his rear,—when Lee had withdrawn to his
fortifications, refusing to accept Grant's challenge to come
out and fight a decisive battle,—wThen all hope of accom¬
plishing either of these objects had vanished, Grant deter¬
mined to return to his original plan of attack from the
coast, and turned his face toward the James river. On
the 12th of June the Army of the Potomac began to
move, and by the 16th it was, with all its trains across,
and on the south side of the James
Petersburg Grant regarded as the citadel of Rich¬
mond, and to capture it was the first thing on his list to
be accomplished. General Butler was made acquainted
