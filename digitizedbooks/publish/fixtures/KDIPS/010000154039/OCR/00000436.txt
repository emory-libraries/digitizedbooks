History of the Black Phalanx.
stone could almost be thrown into the enemy's works, and it was con¬
sidered the most disagreeable portion of the line.
"During the evening of the 4th of September, there was a grand sa¬
lute along the whole line, in honor of the fall of Atlanta At every bat¬
tery the men stood at the guns, and when the monster mortar—"The
Petersburg Express"—gave the expected signal, every lanyard was
pulled. The effect was exceedingly grand.
"At 9 o'clock on the morning of the 5th, the regiment met with an
irreparable loss in the death of Capt. A. R. Walker. Capt- Walker, who
was at the time in the trenches, had raised his head above the parapet
to observe the enemy's movements, when he was struck in the head by a
bullet, and fell without speaking against the parapet. He was carried
back and laid upon the ground in rear of the trench, but all efforts
failed to elicit any token of recognition. He breathed for a few mo¬
ments and life was extinct. His body was sent to the rear the same
afternoon under charge of Lieut. Teeple, upon whom the command of
his company devolved, who made the necessary arrangements for hav¬
ing it embalmed and forwarded to his friends at Caledonia, New York.

"On the 14th Col. Howell, who was commanding the division in the
absence of Gen. Birney, who was absent sick, died of injuries received
from a fall from his horse, and the command of the division devol¬
ved upon Col. Pond. Col. Howell was highly esteemed, and was a
thorough gentleman and a good officer.
"On the 17th, Sergt. Wilson, Company F, color-sergeant, was
reduced to the ranks for cowardice, and Sergt. Griffin, Company B, ap¬
pointed in his place.
"On the 21st, Capt. Thayer resigned.
"On the 22d, Gen. Birney returned and resumed command of the
brigade; the division having been temporarily broken up by the with¬
drawal of troops, and Col. Shaw returned to the regiment.
" On the 23d, companies B and C were detailed to garrison Fort
Steadman.
"On the evening of the 24th, the regiment was relieved from duty
in the trenches by the Sixty-ninth New York, and moving about two
miles to the rear, went into camp with the remainder of the brigade—
some four miles from City Point. Here regular drills and parades were
resumed.
"At 3 p. M. on the 28th, camp was broken, and an hour later the
brigade followed the two divisions of the corps on the road toward Ber¬
muda Hundred. A tedious night-march followed, during which the
north side of the James was reached by way of Broadway and Jones'
landings After an hour or two of rest on the morning of the 29th,
the brigade moved forward as a support to the First Division (Paine's),
the First Brigade of which, under Col. Duncan, charged and carried the
enemy's works on Signal-Hill, on the New Market road, beyond the line
of works taken by the Seventh and Ninth on the 14th of August.* [See
