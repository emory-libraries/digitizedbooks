History of the Black Phalanx.
mounted his brigade and thrown it into line and had warmly opposed a
strong line of infantry or dismounted cavalry, which, after stubborn re¬
sistance, had been driven back to within half a mile of Brice's Cross
Roads."
The columns of the Federals could not do more than
retreat, and if they had been able to do this in any order,
and recover from their exhaustion, they would have been
ready to drive the foe, but they were hotly pursued by the
confederates, who were continually receiving re-enforce¬
ments. It was soon evident that the confederates intended
to gain the rear and capture the whole of the Union
troops. The Federals, therefore, began to retire leisurely.
Says the confederate account:
"General Forrest directed General Buford to open vigorously when
he heard Bell on the left, and, taking with him his escort and Bell's
Brigade, moved rapidly around southeastward to the Guntown-Ripley
road. He formed Wilson's and Bussel's Regiments on the right of the
road, extending to Rucker's left, and placed Newsom's Regiment on the
left of the road; Duffs Regiment, of Rucker's Brigade, was placed on the
left of Newsom; Captain H. A. Tyler, commanding Company A, Twelfth
Kentucky, was ordered by Lyon and subsequently by Forrest to take
his company, with Company C, Seventh Kentucky, and keep mounted on
the extreme left of the line. The escort, under Captain Jackson, moved
around the extreme left of the line, and on striking the Baldwyn and
Pontotoc road about two miles south of the cross roads had a sharp
skirmish and pressed the enemy's cavalry back to where Tishamingo
creek crosses that road; here it was joined by Captain Gartrell's Georgia
company and a Kentucky company. By mutual agreement Captain
Jackson, of the escort, was placed in command of the three companies
and Lieutenant Geroge L. Cowan in command of the escort. Meanwhile
General Buford had ordered Barteau's Second Tennessee Cavalry to
move across the country and gain the Federal rear, and if possible des¬
troy their trains and then strike them in flank."
The gallant conduct of the Federal cavalry inspired
the other troops. They made a stand, and for awhile ad¬
vanced, driving the confederate line before them on the
right, doubling it up and gaining the rear.
The same writer says :
"It was at this critical moment an officer of Bell's staff dashed up to
General Forrest, very much excited, and said: 'General Forrest, the
enemy flanked us and are now in our rear. What shall be done?' For¬
rest. turning in his saddle, very coolly replied.- 'We'll whip these in our
