sums sink into insignificance when compared to that con¬
tributed by the negro soldiers to the erection of a monu¬
ment to the memory of President Lincoln, at the capitol
of the nation; seventeen hundred of them gave ten thou¬

only a people's patriotism that can do such things:
CORRESPONDENCE AND STATEMENTS OF JAMES E. YEATMAN,
President of the Western Sanitary Commission, Relative
to the Emancipation Monument.
"St. Louis, April 26th, 1865.
"JamesE. Yeatman, Esq.:
"My Dear Sir; A poor negro woman, of Marietta, Ohio, one of
those made free by President Lincoln's proclamation, proposes that a
monument to their dead friend be erected by the colored people of the
United States. She has handed to a person in Marietta five dollars as
her contribution for the purpose. Such a monument would have a his¬
tory more grand and touching than any of which we have account.
Would it not be well to take up this suggestion and make it known to
the freedmen?
"Yours truly, T. C. H. Smith."
Mr. Yeatman says:
"In compliance with General Smith's suggestion I published his letter,
with a card, stating that any desiring to contribute to a fund for such a
purpose, that the Western Sanitary Commission would receive the same
and see that it was judiciously appropriated as intended. In response
to his communication liberal contributions were received from colored
soldiers under the command of General J. W. Davidson, head-quarters
at Natchez, Miss., amounting in all to $12,150. This was subsequently
increased from other sources to $16,242.
" Marietta, Ohio, June 29th, 1865.
"Mr. James E. Yeatman, President Western Sanitary Commission, St.
Louis:
"My Dear Sir: I have learned, with the greatest satisfaction,
through Brigadier-General T. C. H. Smith and the public press that
you are devotingyour noble energies in giving tone and direction to the
collection and appropriation of a fund for the erection of the Freedmen's
National Monument, in honor and memory of the benefactor and savior
of their race.
" The general also informs me that you desire, and have requested
through him that the five dollars deposited with the Rev. C. H. Battelle,
of this city, by Charlotte Scott, should be used as the original and foun¬
dation subscription for this most praiseworthy purpose; and Mr. Bat¬
telle assures me that he will most cheerfully remit it to you this day.
As a slave-holder by inheritance, and up to a period after the outbreak
of the rebellion, and as an ardent admirer of our lamented president,
the author of universal emancipation in America, I feel an enthusiastic
interest in the success of the Freedmen's National Monument. I hope it
may stand unequalled and unrivalled in grandeur and magnificence. It
