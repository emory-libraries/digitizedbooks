The Phalanx at Majrion, Tenn.
311
Burbridge piled his overcoat on the ground, and drawing his sword led
his column forward. The men were all on foot and most of the officers.
But few were mounted. It was unpleasant riding under fire where so
many were on foot. "Wade's horse was soon shot, but he kept on with
his men, leading on foot. Looking to the left I saw Burbridge sur¬
rounded by a black crowd of men, his form towering above them and his
sword pointing to the enemy. Wade was first to strike the Confederate
line. They fired and fired, but the darkies kept straight on, closing for a
hand-to-hand fight. Then the cry was raised along the Confederate lines
that the negroes were killing the wounded. Wade went through the
Confederate line like an iron wedge, and it broke and fled. Burbridge hit
hard, but the resistence was less stubborn than in "Wade's front. Of my
own part in the action I prefer not to write. Suffice it to 6ay that never
did soldiers do better on any battle-field than the black men I led that
day.
"When their guns were empty they clubbed them, and I saw one ne¬
gro fighting with a gun barrel, swinging it about his head like a club,
and going straight f6r the enemy. He did not hit anybody for nobody
waited to be hit, but some of the Confederates jumped fully fifteen feet
down the opposite side of that hill to get out of the way of the negroes,
and I would have jumped too, probably, if I had been on their side, for
I never yet saw anything in battle so terrible as an infuriated negro.
"Gillem returned just as night was putting an end to the fighting
and in the approaching darkness we mistook his column for a new col¬
umn of the enemy coming in on our right and rear. Burbridge hurried
back with his victorious negroes and was about to advance with the
Twelfth Ohio Cavalry and Eleventh Michigan, when the glad news came
that the supposed Confederates were Gillem's column returning to our
support.
" During the night Breckenridge retreated in the direction of the salt
works, but Colonel Buckley, returning from the direction of the lead
mines with his brigade, and having got in Breckenridge's rear at Seven
Mile Ford, charged his advance, capturing ten prisoners. Breckenridge,
no doubt thinking he had been outflanked and was about to be enclosed
between two columns, abandoned all idea of going to the salt works and
put back in confusion to Marion,- where he took the North Carolina road
and fled over the mountains. Colonel, Bentley, with his Twelfth Ohio,
was sent up with Breckenridge's rear. The Confederates felled trees across
the road to retard Bentley's advance, but he cleared them out and he
and his gallant regiment hammered Breckenridge's rear all the way into
North Carolina."
The road to the Salt Works was thus opened and their
destruction accomplished by the bravery and matchless
valor of the gallent Sixth. Many of the regiment for¬
feited their lives in rescuing the force from defeat, and
