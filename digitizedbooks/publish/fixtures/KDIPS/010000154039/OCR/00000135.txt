Recruiting and Organizing.

At the outbreak of the Rebellion, the pay of soldiers
(volunteers) was the same as soldiers of the regular army,
by law, $13 per month. The soldiers of the Phalanx
enlisted under the same law and regulations as did the
white volunteers, as to pay and term of service, but the
Secretary of War, after a few regiments were in the field,
decided, and so ordered, that negro troops should be paid
ten dollars per month. The instructions given to General
Saxton on the 25th day of August, 1862, had stated that
the pay would be the same as that of the other troops:
" In view of the small force under your command, and the inability
of the Government at the present time to increase it, in order to guard
the plantations and settlements occupied by the United States, from in¬
vasion, and to protect the inhabitants thereof from captivity and mur¬
der by the enemy, you are also authorized to arm, uniform, equip, and
receive into the service of the United States, such number of volunteers
of African descent as you may deem expedient, not exceeding five thou¬
sand, and may detail officers to instruct them in military drill, discipline
and duty, and to command them. The persons so received into service,
and their officers, to be entitled to, and receive, the same pay and rations
as are allowed, by law, to volunteers in the service
As to the white officers they were paid in full, but the
privates and non-commissioned officers were allowed but
$10 per month, three of which were deducted on account
of clothing. In several instances the paymaster not hav¬
ing received special instructions to that effect, disregarded
the general orders, and paid the negro soldiers in full, like
other volunteers; but the order was generally recognized,
though many of the regiments refused to receive the $7
per month, which was particularly the case of regiments
from the Northern States. The order at one time in the
Department of the Gulf, came very near causing a mu¬
tiny among the troops, because white troops, and con¬
scripts at that, and those who had done provost duty
about the cities, were paid $16 per month,—Congress hav¬
ing raised the pay,—while the Phalanx regiments in the
field and fortifications were offered $7. The dissatisfac¬
tion was so strongly manifested as to cause twelve mem¬
bers of the Phalanx to lose their lives, which were not the
only ones lost by the bad faith on the part of the Govern-
