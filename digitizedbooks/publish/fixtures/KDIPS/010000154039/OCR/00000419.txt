The Phalanx in Virginia.

men rushed forward, descended into the crater, and attempted to pass
through. Colonel Thomas' intention was to go to the right and attack
the enemy's rifle-pits. He partially suceeeded in doing so, but his brig¬
ade was much broken up when it came under the enemy's fire. The gal¬
lant brigade commander endeavored, in person, to rally his command,
and at last formed a storming column, of portions of the 29th, 28th,
23rd, and 19th Regiments of the Phalanx division.'
"' These troops' made a spirited attack, but lost heavily in officers
and became somewhat disheartened. Lieutenant-Colonel Bross, of the
29th, with the colors in his hands, led the charge; was the first man
to leap upon the enemy's works, and was instantly killed. Lieutenant
Pennell seized the colors, but was shot down, riddled through and
through. Major Theodore H. Rockwood, of the 19th, sprang upon the
parapet, and fell while cheering on his regiment to the attack. The
conduct of these officers and their associates was indeed magnificent.
No troops were ever better lead to an assault; had they been allowed
the advance at the outset, before the enemy had recovered from his
first surprise, their charge would have been successful. But it was made
too late. The fire to which they were exposed was very hot and des¬
tructive ; it came from front and flank, it poured into the faces of the
men. It enfiladed their lines. The enemy's rage against the colored
troops had its bloody opportunity."
And they made use of it.
Captain W. L. Fagan, of the 8th Alabama Regiment,
thus gives an account of the fight, from the confederate
side:
" The crater combat, unlike other battles in Virginia, was a series of
deeds of daring, of bloody hand-to-hand fighting, where the survivor
could count with a certainty the men he had slain. A few days ago a
soldier said to me: 'I killed two at the crater; they were not three feet
from me when they fell. I had followed the fortunes of the Confederacy
from Williamsburg to Appomattox Court House, and had, to the morn¬
ing of July 30, only seen two bayonet wounds;—one received at Fra-
zier's Farm, the other at Turkey Ridge, June 3,1864.' Men stood face
to face at the crater. Often a bayonet thrust was given before the
Minie ball went crashing through the body. Every man took care of
himself, intent on selling his life as dearly as possible. The negroes
did not all stampede. They mingled with the white troops. The troops
of Mahone, Wilcox and Wright were greeted with defiant yells, while
their ranks were mowed down by withering fires. Many officers com¬
manding negro troops held their commissions for bravery. Encouraged,
threatened, emulating the white troops, the black men fought with des¬
peration. Some Confederate soldiers recognized their slaves at the
crater. Captain J , of the Forty-first Virginia, gave the military
salute to 'Ben* and 'Bob,* whom he had left hoeing corn down in
