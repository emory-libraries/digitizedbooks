History of the Black Phalanx.
battle^ camp, march and bivouac, was spoken of by tho
commanders of the various armies in terms which any
class of soldiers, of any race, might well be proud of.
General Grant, on the 24th of July, following the cap¬
ture of Vicksburg, wrote to the Adjutant-General:
" The negro troops are easier to preserve discipline among than are
our white troops, and I doubt not will prove equally good for garrison
duty. All that have been tried have fought bravely."
This was six days after the unsurpassed bravery of the
54th Regiment Massachusetts Yolunteers—representing
-the North in the black Phalanx—had planted its blood¬
stained banner on the ramparts of Fort "Wagner. It was
the Southern negroes, who, up to this time, had reddened
the waters of the Mississippi. It was the freedman's blood
that had moistened the soil, and if ignorance could be so
intrepid still greater daring might be expected on the part
of the more intelligent men of the race.
The assault on Fort Wagner, July 18,1863, was one
of the most heroic of the whole four years' war. A very
graphic account of the entire movement is given in the
foil* jwing article:
"At daylight, on the morning of the 12th of July a strong column of
our troops advanced swiftly to the attack of Fort Wagner. The rebels
*wo'.v veil prepared, and swept with their guns every foot of the approach
to the fort, but our soldiers pressed on, and gained a foothold on the
parapet; but, not being supported by other troops, nor aided by the
guns of the fleet, which quietly looked on, they were forced to retreat,
leaving many of their comrades in the hands of the enemy.
"It is the opinion of many that if the fleet had moved up at the
same time, and raked the fort with their guns, our troops would have
succeeded in taking it; but the naval captains said in their defence that
they knew nothing of the movement, and would have gladly assisted in
the attack had they been notified
" This, unfortunately, was not the only instance of a want of har¬
mony or co-operation between the land and naval forces operating
against Charleston. Had they been under the control of one mind, the
sacrifice of life in the siege of Forts "Wagner and Sumter would have been
far less. We will not assume to say which side was at fault, but by far
the greater majority lay the blame upon the naval officers. Warfare
kindles up the latent germs of jealousy in the human breast, and the late
rebellion furnished many cruel examples of its effects, both among the
rebels and among the patriots. We have had the misfortune to witness
