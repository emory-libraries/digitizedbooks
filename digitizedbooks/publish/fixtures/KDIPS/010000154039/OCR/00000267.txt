midst of thousands of their white comrades-in-arms, to
whom they nightly repeated the story of the late terrible
struggle. The solemn sentry pacing the ramparts of
Fort Wagner night and day, his bayonet glittering in the
rays of the sun or in the moonlight, seemed to be guard¬
ing the sepulchre of Col. Shaw and those who fell beside
him within the walls of that gory fort, and who were
buried where they fell. Only those who have lived in such
a camp can appreciate the stories of hair-breadth escapes
from hand-to-hand fightg.
The repose lasted until January, when an important
movement took place for the permanent occupation of
Florida. A detailed account of which, and some of its
disasters, is given in the following newspaper statement:
"The twentieth day of February, 1864, was one of the most disas¬
trous to the Federal arms, and to the administration of President Lin¬
coln, in the annals of the war for the union. Through private advice
Mr. Lincoln had received information which led him to believe that the

transports, commissary stores, drilling troops, etc., etc.
"About the 1st, of January, 1864, General Gillmore wrote to the
General-in-Chief, Halleck, that he was about to occupy the west bank of
St. Johns river, with the view (1st) to open an outlet to cotton, lumber,
