The regiment was designated the 1st A. D. (African De¬
scent) Regiment Iowa Volunteers, and was mustered for
three years, or during the war. Leaving Keokuk Bar¬
racks, the regiment proceeded to St. Louis, Mo., and was
quartered in Benton Barracks, as a. part of the forces un¬
der command of Major-General J. M. Schofield. Here
company G. joined the regiment, making ten full compa¬
nies. A memorable and patriotic incident occurred here:
Mrs. I. N. Triplet, in behalf of the ladies of the State of
Iowa, and of the city of Muscatine, presented the regiment

July, Colonel W. S. Brooks, in command of the 56th, 60th,
and a detachment of the 3rd Artillery Phalanx Regiment,
with two field guns, sallied out of Helena and proceeded
down the Mississppi River, to the mouth of White River,
on a transport. Here the troops disembarked. The next
morning, after marching all night, Brooks halted his com¬
mand for breakfast; arms were stacked and the men be¬
