The Phalanx at Marion, Tenn.

was attached to the 3rd brigade, which Colonel Jas. F.
Wade, of the 6th, commanded. Gillem's defeat rather in¬
spired the men in the new column, and they dashed for¬
ward with a determination to annihilate the enemy. Four
days after leaving Bean Station, the confederates were
overtaken at Marion, General Vaughn being in command,
and were routed, the Federals capturing all their guns,
trains and a number of prisoners. Vaughn fell back to
Wytheville, pursued by the Federals, who captured and
destroyed the town, with its stores and supplies and the
extensive lead mines.
Having accomplished their mission, the Federals about
faced for Marion, where they met with a large force of don-

an advance regiment succeeded in crossing the bridge,
after re-laying the planks which the confederates had torn

next morning. The 6th Phalanx was assigned its usual
position, and was held in reserve. The battle opened in

his troops badly beaten, and unable to extricate them¬
selves from the confederate coil; they were not the "Old
Guard," and the question with them was not "victory
or death," but surrender or death. Nor was this long a
question. General Stoneman ordered up the 6th Phalanx,
dividing them into three columns, placing himself at the
head of one, and giving one each to Colonel Wade, (their
valiant colonel), and his chief of staff, General Brisbin.
The regiment dashed into the fight for the rescue of the
pro-slavery Kentucldans and haughty Tennesseeians, who
were now nearly annihilated. The historian of this cam¬

this battle had attempted to shoot one of the brave black
