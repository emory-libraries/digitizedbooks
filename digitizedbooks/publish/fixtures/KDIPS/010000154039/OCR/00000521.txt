much sickness prevailed, the change of climate telling severely upon the
untried soldiers. In less than two months a decided improvement in
drill and discipline had been effected, and our dress parades began to
attract marked attention. But as yet our soldiers had not fired a shot
at the rebellion, and had still to be tried in the fiery ordeal of battle.
At last events on the bloody fields of Virginia determined our destiny.
"The battles fought during the summer campaign had demonstrated
that negro troops could fight well; they had also shown that more men
were required in Virginia, and that we could not await the slow process
of a draft to get them. The success of the entire campaign seemed dubiÂ¬
ous, and the army, after all its gigantic toils and losses, found itself
confronted by strong lines of works, manned by a brave and resolute
foe. Under these circumstances the only policy was concentration in
Virginia. Accordingly all the troops that could be spared from other
points were ordered to Virginia.
"Among the numberwas the29th Connecticut Volunteers (colored).
On the 8th day of August, 1864, the regiment left Beaufort, S. C., and
disembarked at Bermuda Hundreds, Va., on the 14th of the same month.
This regiment was brigaded with the 7th, 8th, and 9th tJnited States
Colored Troops, forming with other colored regiments a division of the
10th Army Corps. "We arrived just as the active movements terminating
in the capture of the Weldon Bailroad had commenced. That railroad
being on the then extreme left of our line it was deemed advisable, as a
feint, to keep the enemy well engaged on our right. For this purpose
the 2d and 10th Army Corps had been assembled, as secretly as possible,
near Bermuda Hundreds, and on the morning of August 14th had
advanced upon the enemy's works near Deep Bottom.
"This regiment accompanied the force as far as Deep Bottom, where,
with the 7th United States Colored Troops and one light battery, itwas
left to defend the post, under command of Colonel Wooster. The two
corps moved farther to the right and front, and soon became warmly
engaged. During the fighting General Butler, desirous to ascertain the
strength and position of the enemy immediately in our front, ordered
Colonel Wooster to make a reconnoissance with this regiment and the
7th United States Colored Troops.
"This was successfully accomplished, the men in this their first
encounter with the enemy, displaying great coolness and bravery.
Soon after this we were relieved and ordered to join our brigade, then
actively engaged at the front.
" "VVe set out in a drenching rain storm, and after a tiresome march
reached the battle-field about dark. Our forces had suffered a bloody
repulse, and had just finished burying our dead under a flag of truce.
The burial parties with their bloody stretchers were returning, and the
sharp crack of the rifle began again to be heard, and so continued with
more or less fierceness during the night.
"At daylight hostilities, except on the picket line, were not resumed.
The opposing forces lay and narrowly watched each other's movements.
