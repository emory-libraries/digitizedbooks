The Black Flag.

stantly we apologized, as we expected the General to intimate that it
was none of our business where he went. He, however, stepped down the
hill out of danger and seating himself behind a tree, seemed for a few
moments in deep study, but soon the head of our cavalry column arriv¬
ing, he turned to me and said: ' Captain, as soon as you hear me open
on the right and flank of the enemy over yonder,' pointing to the en¬
emy's position, 'charge with your artillery down that lane and cross the
branch.' The genial and gallant Captain Rice ccrming up at this time
and hearing the order, turned to me and said: ' By G-d! whoever heard
of artillery charging?' Captain Brice's Battery had been stationed at
Columbus, Miss., and other points on local duty, and only a few months
previous had been ordered and assigned to our command. He accepted
his initiation into the ways and methods of horse artillery with much
spirit and good grace.
"Meanwhile, watching Forrest at the head of the cavalry moving
through the woods and across the field in the direction of the enemy's
right, I directed Lieutenants Tully, Brown and H. H. Briggs, whose sec¬
tions had been held in the road below the Hadden house for an emer¬
gency, to be ready to move into action at a moments notice. The
enemy, observing our cavalry passing to their right, began to break and
retire through the woods. Forrest, seeing this, dashed upon them in
column of fours. At the same moment Lieutenant Brown pressed his
section down the road, even in advance of the skirmish line, and opened
a terrific fire upon the enemy, now breaking up and in full retreat. Lieu¬
tenant Briggs also took an advanced position and got in a few well-di¬
rected shots. Brown's section and a section of Rice's Battery were
pushed forward across Phillips' branch and up the hill under a sharp fire,
the former taking position on the right o/ the road and the latter in the
road just where the road turns before reaching Dr. Agnew's house.
"Our skirmishers had driven the enemy's skirmishers upon their
main line, when we were about to make another artillery charge, but dis¬
tinctly hearing the Federal officers giving orders to their men to stand
steady and yell, 'Remember Fort Pillow.' 'Charge! charge! charge!'
ran along their lines, and on they came. Our right was pressed back on
the'negro avengers of Fort Pillow.' They moved steadily upon our
guns and for a moment their loss seemed imminent. Our cannoneers,
standing firm and taking in the situation, drove double-shotted cannister
into this advancing line. The cavalry rallying on our guns sent death
vplleys into their ranks, which staggered the enemy and drove them
back, but only to give place to a new line that now moved down upon us
with wild shouts and got almost within hand-shaking distance of our
guns.
"Lyon coming up opportunely at this-moment formed his brigade
on our right, and springing forward with loud cheers, hurled them back
with so stormful an onset that their entire line gave way in utter rout
and confusion. Lieutenant Brown's horse was shot under him. The
gallant young soldier, Henry King, of Rice's Battery, fell with his ram
