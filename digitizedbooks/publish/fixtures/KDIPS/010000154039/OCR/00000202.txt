History of the Black Phalanx.
only armed, but some of them had been in skirmishes with
the enemy. That as a Phalanx they were invaluable in
crushing the rebellion, let their acts of heroism tell. In
the light of history and of their own deeds, it can be said
that in courage, patriotism and dash, they were second to
no troops, either in ancient or modern armies. They were
enlisted after rigid scrutiny, and the examination of every
man by competent surgeons. Their acquaintance with
the country in which they marched, encamped and fought,
made them in many instances superior to the white
troops. Then to strengthen their valor and tenacity, each
soldier of the Phalanx knew when he heard the long roll
beat to arms, and the bugle sound the charge, that they
were not to go forth to meet those who regarded them as
opponents in arms, but who met them as a man in his last
desperate effort for life would meet demons; they knew,

brigade prevented a slaughter of the Union troops. The
black Phalanx were represented there by a brigade at¬

confederates routed the army under Banks at Sabine Cross
Roads, below Mansfield, they drove it for several hours
toward Pleasant Grove, despite the ardor of the combined
forces of Banks and Franklin. It became apparent that un¬
less the confederates could be checked at this point, all wae
lost. General Emory prepared for the emergency on the
western edge of a wood, with an open field sloping toward
Mansfield. Here General Dwight formed a brigade of the
black Phalanx across the road. Hardly was the line
formed when out came the gallant foe driving 10,000 mer
before them. Flushed with two days' victory, they came
