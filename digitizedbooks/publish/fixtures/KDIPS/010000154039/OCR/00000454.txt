History of the Black Phalanx.
From the signal tower bright lights were discernable at
Richmond. The city appeared to be on fire; a confederate
picket was captured, but he knew nothing; he had got
astray from his comrades and command. A deserter
came in with intelligence that the city was being evacu¬
ated, and half an hour later a negro drove into camp and
gave information that the enemy was flying.
The ground in front was thickly set wTith torpedoes,
and the troops dared not move. Day came and Colonel
Draper's black brigade of the 25th Corps went forward.
The road was lumbered with all manner and sort of milit¬
ary gear and munitions of war. Keeping clear of the red
flags which marked the torpedoes, the troops pushed on;
they soon reached the defences of the city to find them
untenanted; the negro had told the truth and the Pha¬
lanx brigade entered the city welcomed by thousands of
happy kinsfolks. Badeau says:
" The sun was an hour up, when suddenly there rose in the streets
thfe cry of 'Yankees! Yankees!' and the mass of plunderers and rioters,
cursing, screaming, trampling on each other, alarmed by an enemy not

national colors, and then, in the morning light of the 3d of April, the
flag of the United States once more floated over Eichmond.
" The command of Weitzel followed—a long blue line—with gun-bar¬
rels gleaming, and bands playing 'Hail Columbia' and 'John Brown's
Soul Goes Marching On.'. One regiment was black.* The magistrates
formally surrendered the city to Weitzel at the Capitol, which stands on
a hill in the centre of the town, and overlooks the whole country for
miles. The national commander at once set about restoring order and
extinguishing the flames. Guards were established, plundering was
stopped, the negroes were organized into a fire corps, and by night the
force of the conflagration was subdued, the rioting was at an end, and
the conquered city was rescued by the efforts of its captors from the
evils which its own authorities had allowed, and its own population had
perpetrated."
Lee and his famishing host were fleeing towards Dan¬
ville, hotly pursued by the Federal Army. Resting there
