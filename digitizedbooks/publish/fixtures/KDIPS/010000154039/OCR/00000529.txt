most point of danger in the coming struggle, and says that his men are
as ready as himself to stake their lives upon the result; but the general
—doubtless acting upon explicit orders—says they must, at present at
least, be confined to manning the fortifications here.
" I am happy to say that the feeling toward these colored regiments
throughout the army is undergoing the most rapid and extraordinary
changes. Soldiers that only a tew months, nay, weeks ago, would have
flown into a furious passion at the bare idea of a black man carrying a
musket like themselves, now say, ' O, if you are going to give them white
officers that is another affair altogether.'"
The following letter gives some interesting recollec¬
tions of the military events of the Department of the
Gulf:
"New Orleans, January 18th, 1883.
"To Colonel J. T. Wilson, Norfolk, Va.:
"Friend : Your two circulars issued from Cailloux Post No. 2 on
the 13th inst. are received. It is quite a compliment to Louisiana to
have named your Post after the hero of Port Hudson, who immortalized
himself in those celebrated charges in May, 1863.
" It is over twenty years ago that I took a commission in the 3d
Louisiana Native Guard as a senior lieutenant of Company H. I was
quite intimate with Captain Andre Cailloux.
"Grave doubts had been expressed by Banks, the nominal com¬
mander, and his officers regarding the fitness of colored meij as soldiers.
The perplexing question was, 'Will they stand their christening under
such a hail storm as will come from those bristling Port Hudson heights?'
In fact those three colored regiments—the 1st, 2d, and 3d Louisiana
Native Guards, organized in 1862, and afterward incorporated in the
Ullman Brigade as the 73d, 74th, and 75th—had become more a subject
of test than of real dependence at the critical juncture of trial.
" General Osterhaus solved the mystery by taking command of a
division, including the 1st and 3d Native Guards. Those magnificent
series of charges were made by these two regiments. The first charge was
made on a Sunday, the 27th day of May, 1863, supported on the right
by the celebrated Duryea's Zouaves, of New York, which were mowed
down like grass before a scythe. It was then and there that Captain
Cailloux gloriously died in advance of his company while cheering his
men. Itwas also on that day that the immortal color-bearer, Anselino,
"was killed, and fell within the folds of his regimental flag, which was
besmeared with his blood, with the broken flag-staff in his hand. Other
strong arms came to the rescue of the flag only to meet death until the
honor of the flag alone cost the lives of sixteen men or more. The gal¬
lant Lieutenant Crowder was killed on the field of honor at the flower of
his age. Captain Sauer was wounded in the foot while charging. The
3d NativeGuards also sustained its reputation, and many deeds of valor
were performed by its officers and men. But when after those engage¬
ments the roll-call was made we had many friends to mourn. You are
aware, I suppose, of an historical fact. Jefferson Davis had issued a
proclamation that any colored officer captured at the head of black
troops would not be exchanged, but immediately hung. It was thus
that Lieutenent ORcar Orillion, when captured at Jackson, La., was
hung and shot to pieces.
"Port Hudson was surrendered by General Pemberton the 8th of
July 1863. General Osterhaus became very proud of his colored regi¬
ments after what he had seen at Port Hudson.
