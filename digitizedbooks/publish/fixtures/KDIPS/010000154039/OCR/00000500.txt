UNION SOLDIERS BEFORE YORKTOWN BRINGING DOWN
A SOUTHERN ALLY.
This negro being a good marksman was induced b.v the confederates to become a
sharpshooter for them, and greatly annoyed the Union pickets before Yorktown by
firing upon them from trees, in the branches of which he would perch himself at early
morning and remain there through the day, shooting at such Union soldiers as hapÂ¬
pened come within his range. His hiding place was finally discovered however, and
after refusing to surrender, thinking himself safe, he was brought down by a bullet
through his head.
