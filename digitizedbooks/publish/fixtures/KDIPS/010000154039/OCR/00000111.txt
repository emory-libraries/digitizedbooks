crats to do this ? It was a free fight, and the field was open to the war
Democrats to put down this rebellion by fighting against both master
and slave, Jong before the present policy was inaugurated. There have
been men base enough to propose to me to return to slavery the black
warriers of Port Hudson and Olustee, and thus win the respect of the
masters they fought. Should I do so, I should deserve to be dammed in
time and eternity. Come what will, I will keep my faith with friend and
foe. My enemies pretend I am now carrying on this war for the sole pur¬
pose of abolition. So long as I am President, it shall be carried on for
the sole purpose of restoring the Union. But no human power can subdue
this rebellion without the use of the emancipation policy, and every
other policy calculated to weaken the moral and physical forces of the
rebellion. Freedom has given us two hundred thousand men raised on
southern soil. It will give us more yet. Just so much it has subtracted
from the enemy; and instead of alienating the South, there are now
evidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our men and the
rank and file of the rebel soldiers. Let my enemies prove to the country
that the destruction of slavery is not neeessary to the restoration of the
Union. I will abide the issue."
But the change of policy did not change the opinion
of the Southerners, who, notwithstanding the use which
the Confederate Government was making of the negro,
still regarded him, in the United States uniform, as a vic¬
ious brute, to be shot at sight. I prefer, in closing this
chapter, to give the Southern opinion of the negro, in the
words of a distinguished native of that section. Mr.
George W. Cable, in his " Silent South," thus gives it:
" He was brought to our shores a naked, brutish, unclean, captive,
pagan savage, to be and remain a kind of connecting link between man.
and the beasts of burden. The great changes to result from his contact
with a superb race of masters were not taken into account. As a social
factor he was intended to be as purely zero as the brute at the other end
of his plow line. The occasional mingling of his blood -with that of the
white man worked no change in the sentiment; one, two, four, eight,
multiplied upon or divided in to zero, still gave zero for the result. Gen¬
erations of American nativity made no difference; his children and chil-
drens' children were born in sight of our door, yet the old notion held
fast. He increased to vast numbers, but it never wavered. He accepted
our dress, language, religion, all the fundamentals of our civilization,
and became forever expatriated from his own land; still he remained, to
us, an alien. Our sentiment went blind. It did not see that gradually,
here by force and there by choice, he was fulfilling a host of conditions
that earned at least a solemn moral right to that naturalization which
no one at first had dreamed of giving him. Frequently he even bought
