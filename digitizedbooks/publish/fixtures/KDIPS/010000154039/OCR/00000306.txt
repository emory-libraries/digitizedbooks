History of the Black Phalanx.
tion was still on the extreme left of our line, and I was especially charged
to look well to our flank, to avoid surprise.
"The 2nd Colored Brigade, under Colonel Thompson, of the 12th U.
S. C. I., was on my right, and participated in the first days' charge
upon Overton's Hill, which was repulsed. I stood where the whole
movement was in full view. It was a grand and terrible sight to see
those men climb that hill over rocks and fallen trees, in the face of a
murderous fire of cannon and musketry, only to be driven back. White
and black mingled together in the charge, and on the retreat.
" When the 2nd Colored Brigade retired behind my lines to re-form,
one of the regimental color-bearers stopped in the open space between
the two armies, where, although exposed to a dangerous fire, he planted
his flag firmly in the ground, and began deliberately and coolly to return
the enemy's fire, and, greatly to our amusement, kept up for some little
time his independent warfare.
"When the second and final assault was made, the right of my line
took part. It was with breathless interest I watched that noble army
climb the hill with a steady resolve which nothing but death itself could
check. When at length the assaulting column sprang upon the earth¬
works, and the enemy seeing that further resistance was madness, gave
way and began a precipitous retreat, our hearts swelled as only the
hearts of soldiers can, and scarcely stopping to cheer or to await orders,
we pushed forward and joined in the pursuit, until the darkness and the
rain forced a halt.
"The battle of Nashville did not compare in numbers engaged, in
severity of fighting, or in the losses sustained, with some other Western
battles. But in the issues at stake, the magnificent generalship of
Thomas, the completeness of our triumph, and the immediate and far-
reaching consequences, it was unique, and deservedly ranks along with
Gettysburg, as one of the decisive battles of the war.
"When General Thomas rode over the battle-field and saw the bodies
of colored men side by side with the foremost, on the very works of the
enemy, he turned to his staff, saying: 'Gentlemen, the question is set¬
tled ; negroes will fight.' He did me the honor to recommend me for pro¬
motion, and told me that he intended to give me the best brigade that
he could form. This he afterward did.
"After the great victory, we joined in the chase after the fleeing foe.
Hood's army was whipped, demoralized, and pretty badly scattered. A
good many stragglers were picked up. A story circulated to this effect:
Some of our boys on making a sharp turn in the road, came upon a for¬
lorn Southern soldier, who had lost his arms, thrown away his accoutre¬
ments, and was sitting on a log by the roadside, waiting to give himself
up. He was saluted with, 'Well, Johnny, how goes it?' 'Well, Yank,
I'll tell ye; I confess I'm horribly whipped, and badly demoralized, but
blamed if I'm scattered!'
"After we Bad passed along through Franklin, we had orders to
turn about and return to that city. I was riding at the head of the col-
