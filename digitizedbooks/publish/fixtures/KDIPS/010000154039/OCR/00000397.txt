the fathers of the men whom it now sought to uphold, in
rebellion against the government of the United States:
"THE NEGRO UNION SOLDIERS.
"Six months have now passed from the time Mr. Lincoln issued his
proclamation abolishing slavery in the States of the Southern Confed¬
eracy. To many it may seem that this measure has failed of the in¬
tended effect and this is doubtless in some respects the case. It was in¬
tended to frighten the Southern whites into submission, and it has only
made them more fierce and resolute than ever. It was intended to raise a
servile war, or produce such signs of it as should compel the Confederates
to lay down their arms through fear for their wives and families; and it
has only caused desertion from some of the border plantations and
some disorders along the coast. But in other respects the consequences
of this measure are becoming important enough. The negro race has
been too much attached to the whites, or too ignorant or too sluggish
to show any signs' of revolt in places remote from the presence of the
federal armies: but on some points where the federals have been able
to maintain themselves in force in the midst of a large negro popula¬
tion, the process of enrolling and arming black regiments has been car¬
ried on in a manner which must give a new character to the war. It is
in the State of Louisiana, and under the command of General Banks,
that this use of negro soldiers has been most extensive. The great city
of New Orleans having fallen into the possession of the federals more
more than a year ago, and the neighboring country being to a certain
degree abandoned by the white population, a vast number of negroes
have been thrown on the hands of the General in command to support
and, if he can, make use of. The arming of these was begun by General
Butler, and it has been continued by his successor. Though the number
actually under arms is no doubt exaggerated by Northern writers, yet
enough have been brought into service to produce a powerful effect on
the imaginations of the the combatants, and, as we can now clearly see,
to add almost grievously to the fury of the struggle.
" Of all wars, those between races which had been accustomed to
stand to each other in the relation of master and slave have been so
much, the most horrible that by general consent the exciting of a ser¬
vile insurrection has been considered as beyond the pale of legitimate
warfare. This had been held even in the case of European serfdom, al¬
though there the rulers and the ruled are of the same blood, religion
and language. But the conflict between the white men and the negro,
and particularly the American white man and the American negro, is
likely to be more ruthless than any which the ancient world, fruitful in
such histories, or the modern records of Algeria can furnish. There was
reason to hope that the deeds of 1857 in India would not be paralleled
in our time or in any after age. The Asiatic savagery rose upon a domi-
nent race scattered throughout the land, and wreaked its vengeance
upon it by atrocities which it would be a relief to forget. But it lias
