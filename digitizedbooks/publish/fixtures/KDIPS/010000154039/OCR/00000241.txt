"to. Again were they forced to fall back, and twice during this conflict were their colors
brought to the ground, but as often raised.
' During these engagements fully one-half of my infantry engaged were either killed
or wounded. Three companies were left without any officers, and seeing the enemy
again re-enforced with fresh troops, it became evident that 1 could hold my line but
little longer. I now directed Maj. Ward to hold the line until I could ride back and
form the 18th Iowa in proper shape to support the retreat of the advanced line.
'Meanwhile, so many of the gunners had been shot from around their pieces that
there were not enough to serve the guns, so I ordered them to retire to therearof the train,
and report to the cavalry officer there. J ust as I was starting for the line of the 18th
Iowa, my horse was shot, which delayed me until another could be procured, when I
rode to the rear and formed a line of battle facing in the direction the enemy was ad¬
vancing.
' Again did the enemy hurl his columns against the remnant of men that formed my
front and right flank, and again were they met as gallantly as before. But my deci¬
mated ranks were unable to resist the overpowering force hurled against them, and
after their advance had been checked, seeing that our lines were completely flanked on
both sides, Major Ward gave the order to retire, which was done in good order, form¬
ing and charging the enemy twice before reaching the rear of the train.
' With the assistance of Major Ward and other officers, I succeeded in forming a
portion of the 1st Kansas Colored in the rear of the 18th Iowa, and when the enemy
approached this line, they gallantly advanced to the line of the 18th, and with them
poured in their fires The 18th maintained their line manfully, and stoutly contested the
ground until nearly surrounded, when they retired, and forming again, checked the ad¬
vancing foe, and still held their ground until again nearly surrounded, when they
again retired across a ravine which was impassable for artillery, and I gave orders for
the piece to be spiked and abandoned.
' After crossing the ravine I succeeded in forming a portion of the cavalry, which I
kept in order to give the infantry time to cross the swamp which lay in our front,
which they succeeded in doing. By this means nearly all, except the badly wounded,
were enabled to reach the camp. Many wounded men belonging to the 1st Kansas Col¬
ored fell into the hands of the enemy, and I have the most positive assurance from eye¬
witnesses that they were murdered on the spot. I was forced to abandon everything to
the enemy, and they thereby became possessed of the large train.
' With two six pounder guns and two twelve pounder mountain howitzers, together
with what force could be collected, I made my way to this post, where I arrived at 11
p. m. of the same day.
' At no time during the engagement, such was the nature of the ground and size of
the train, was I obliged to employ more than five hundred men and two guns to repel
the assaults of the enemy, whose force, from the statement of prisoners, I estimate at
ten thousand men and twelve guns. The columns of assault which were again thrown
against my front and right flank consisted of five regiments of infantry and one of cav¬
alry, supported by a strong force which operated against my left flank and rear. My
loss, in killed, wounded and missing during this engagement was as foilows: Killed—
ninety-two, wounded—ninety-seven, missing—one hundred and six.
'Many of those reported missing are supposed to have been killed, others are sup¬
posed to have been wounded and taken prisoners. The loss of the enemy is not known,
but in my opinion it will exceed our own. The conduct of all the troops under my com¬
mand, officers and men, were characterized by true soldiery bearing, and in no case was
a line broken, except when assaulted by an overwhelming force, and then falling back
only when so ordered. The officers and men all evinced the most heroic spirit, and
those that fell died the |death of the true soldier. The action commenced at 10 a. m.,
and terminated at 2 p. m. I have named this engagement the action of Poison Springs,
from a spring of that name in the vicinity.
' Very respectfully yours,
'J. M. WILLIAMS,
' Colonel 1st Kansas Colored Vol. Infantry, Commanding Expedition.
*Capt. We S, Whitten, Assistant Adjutant General.'
" On the 26th day of April following, Gen. Steele's command evacu¬
ated Camden and marched for Little Bock. At Saline Crossing, on the
30th of April, the rear of Gen. Steele's command was attacked by the en¬
tire force of the enemy, commanded by Gen. Kirby Smith. The engage¬
ment which followed resulted in the complete defeat of the enemy, with
great loss on his part. In this engagement the 1st Kansas Colored was
not an active participant, being at the moment of the attack in the
advance, distant five miles from the rear and scene of the engagement.
The regiment was ordered back to participate in the battle, but did not
arrive on the line until after the repulse of the enemy and his retirement
from the field.
