"Brevet Major-General J. W. Davidson, commanding District of Nat¬
chez, Miss.:
" General : I have the honor to enclose the sum of two thousand
nine hundred and forty-nine dollars and fifty cents as the amount col¬
lected, under your suggestion, for the purpose of erecting a monument
to the memory of President Lincoln. Every dollar of this money has
been subscribed by the black enlisted men of my regiment, which has
only an aggregate of six hundred and eighty-three men. Much more
might have been raised, but I cautioned the officers to check the noble
generosity of my men rather than stimulate it. Allow me to add that
the soldiers expect that the monument is to be built by black people's
money exclusively. They feel deeply that the debt of gratitude they
owe is large, and any thing they can do to keep his 'memory green' will
be done cheerfully and promptly.
"If there is a monument built proportionate to the veneration with
which the black people hold his memory, then its summit will be among
the clouds—the first to catch the gleam and herald the approach of
coming day, even as President Lincoln himself first proclaimed the first
gleam as well as glorious light of universal freedom.
"I am, general, most respectfully, your obedient servant,
"W. C. EARLES,
" Colonel 70th United States Colored Infantry"
"District of Natchez, May 21st, 1865.
"Hon. James E. Yeatman:
"Upon seeing your suggestions in the Democrat I wrote to my colo¬
nels of colored troops, and they are responding most nobly to the call.
Farrar's regiment, 6th United States Heavy Artillery, sent some $4,700.
The money here spoken of has been turned over to Major W. C. Lupton,
Pay-master U. S. A., for you. Please acknowledge receipt through the
Missouri Democrat. The idea is, that the monument shall be raised to
Mr. Lincoln's memory at the national capital exclusively by the race he
has set free. Very truly yours,
"J. W. DAVIDSON, Brevet Major-General.

Davidson comipanding, feeling the great obligations they are under to
