History of the Black Phalanx.
boys of the 6th for retaliating for the murder of one of
his comrades by shooting a confederate prisoner, thus
writes, twenty-two years afterwards, about the battle and
the conduct of the 6th:
" Early in the day General Stoneman had sent General Gillem off to
the right with orders to get in Breckenridge's rear and if possible cut
him off from the salt works. It was believed the Kentucky troops could
handle Breckenridge until Gillem could strike in the rear, but the action
in front about noon became terrific and Gillem was recalled to aid Bur-
bridge. Our right flank had been driven back and. our extreme left was
almost at right angles with the original position held early in the morn¬
ing. To add to our misfortunes, a party of Confederate cavalry had got
in our rear and captured some of our pack'train. The packers had at
one time become demoralized and fell back almost into the hands of the
Confederates operating in our rear. General Burbridge saw the move¬
ment, and drawing his revolver placed himself in front of the leading
packs and ordered them back, but the crazy men kept on until the Gen¬
eral wounded the man who was leading them off, and with the aid of
some officers who used their sabres freely, the packs were forced back
into the timber close to our lines and compelled to stay there. Thus
over five hundred packs and animals were saved to the army by the
prompt action of the General and his aids.
"At 3:30 o'clock the situation was critical in the extreme. Colonel
Boyle had been killed in leading a charge and his regiment repulsed. The
Twelfth Ohio Cavalry had promptly come to Boyle's support and checked
the confederates, who were coming into our centre. The hospital in our
rear, where our sick were, had been charged, and for a short time was in
the hands of the enemy. Burbridge and Stoneman had their headquar¬
ters on a little knoll near the centre of our line, where they could see the
fighting. The Confederate right, in swinging around, had covered this
hill and it was no longer tenable. A lieutenant, in reporting to General
Burbridge on this knoll, had been shot by a Confederate rifleman
through the head and fell dead at the General's feet. Orderlies, horses
and men were being shot down, and I begged General Burbridge to re¬
tire. He asked me if there were no more troops we could bring up and
put into action. I told him all we had left was the Sixth United States
Colored Cavalry and the horse-holders. He said:
"' Well, go and bring up the negroes and tell everybody to tie the
horses as well as they can. We might as well lose them as to be whipped,
when we will lose them anyway.'
"I made haste to bring up the Sixth Colored and all the horse-hold¬
ers I could get. The Sixth Colored was a fine regiment, but few had faith
in the fighting qualities of the negroes. General Burbridge divided them
into three columns, and taking one himself gave the other two to Gen¬
eral Wade and myself. Wade had the right, Burbridge the left and I
was in the centre. Wad^ got off first and sailed in in gallant style.
