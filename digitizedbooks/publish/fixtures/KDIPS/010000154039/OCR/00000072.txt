History of the Black Phalanx.

to be set aside, merely to accommodate those who had
rendered the nation's cause no help or assistance. Gen.
Putnam received the following letter, which needs no
explanation:
" Headquarters, Feb. 2,1783.
"Sir:—Mr. Hobby having claimed as his property a negro man now
serving in the Massachusetts Regiment, you will please to order a court
of inquiry, consisting of five as respectable officers as can be found in
your brigade, to examine the validity of the claim and the manner in which
the person in question came into service. Having inquired into the mat¬

could collect, I supposed the State of Virginia lost, under Lord Cornwal¬
lis' hand, that year, about thirty thousand slaves; and that, of these,
twenty-seven thousand died of the small-pox and camp fever; the rest
were partly sent to the "West Indies, and exchanged for rum, sugar,
coffee and fruit; and partly sent to New York, from whence they went,at
the peace, either to Nova Scotia or to England. From this last place, I
believe they have lately been sent to Africa. History will never relate
the horrors committed by the British army in the Southern States of
America."
The heroism of the negro soldier has ever been eulo¬
