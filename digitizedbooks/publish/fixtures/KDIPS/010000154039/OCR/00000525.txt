was ordered to Texas. "We embarked for Texas on the 10th day of
June 1865, arriving at Brazos de Santiago July 3rd, 1865. From
Brazos we marched to Brownsville, on the Eio Grande, where we contin¬
ued until ordered to Hartford, Conn., to be mustered out. On the 26th
day of October, 1865, we left Brownsville for Hartford, where the regi¬
ment was discharged and paid on the 25th day of November, 1865.
"The following is a report of changes and casualties in the 29th

" loss 13
"Wounded, officers, 6; men, 102. Captured, officer, 1; missing, none.
"It will be necessary to remark here that fully one hundred per cent
of our desertions occurred while at New Haven, and during the organiza¬
tion of the regiment very few desertions occurred after we left the State.
Our total of killed and wtmnded was—enlisted men, 123; officers, 6.
The officer who was captured eventually re-joined us. The officers lost
by promotion into other organizations were—Lieutenant-Colonel H. C.
"Ward, promoted to be colonel of the 31st United States Colored Troops;
Major F. E.Camp, promoted to be lieutenant-colonel of the 29th United
States Colored Troops; Captain E. "W. Bacon, promoted to be major of
the 117th United States Colored Troops; Assistant Surgeon Crandall,
promoted to be surgeon of the 33d United States Colored Troops; 1st
Lieutenant H. H. Brown, promoted to be captain of the 1st United
States Colored Troops; 2d Lieutenant Edward Coe, promoted to be 1st
lieutenant and adjutant of the 27th United States Colored Troops.
"Thus have I attempted to trace the history of this regiment. I
have done this with some degree of minuteness, owing to the fact that,
as we were considered a United States organization less can be learned
concerning us from the reports of the adjutant-general of the State than
concerning any other Connecticut organization, And as the employment
of colored troops was at first tried as a grand experiment, the people of
Connecticut may be desirous to know how far, in the case of their colored
regiment, that experiment has been successful. Justice, too, demands
that those who are the most competent judges—those who have been
with the colored troops on the march and in the battle—should give
their testimony to the loyalty and valor of this despised race. They
went forth to fight the battles of the Union when there was every thing
to discourage even the bravest. Both officers and men knew, that should
they escape death on the battle-field a fate awaited them, if captured,
