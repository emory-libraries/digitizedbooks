History of the Black Phalanx.
nigh exhausted. At 7 o'clock the column, was again, put in motion on
the Salem road, the cavalry in advance, followed by the infantry. The
enemy pressed heavily on the rear, and there was now nothing left but
to keep in motion so as to prevent the banking up of the rear, and to
pass all cross-roads before the enemy could reach them, as the command
was in no condition to offer determined resistance, whether attacked in
the front or the rear. At 8 o'clock a. m. on the 12th, the column reached
Colliersville, worn out and exhausted by the fatigues of fighting and
marching for two days and two nights without rest and without eating.
About noon of the same day a train arrived from Memphis, bringing
some 2,000 infantry, commanded by Colonel Wolf, and supplies for my
suffering men, and I determined to remain here until next day for the
purpose of resting and affording protection to many who had dropped
by the wayside, through fatigue and other causes. Learning, however,
toward evening, that the commander at White's Station had informa¬
tion of a large force of the enemy approaching that place from the
southeast, and knowing that my men were in no condition to offer seri¬
ous resistance to an enemy presenting himself across my line of march,
I informed the general commanding the district, by telegraph, that I
deemed it prudent to continue my march to White's Station. Accord¬
ingly, at 9 p. m., the column marched again, and arrived at White's
Station at daylight next morning. This report having already become
more circumstantial than was anticipated, I have purposely omitted the
details of our march from Ripley to White's Station, as they would ex¬
tend it to a tiresome length, but would respectfully refer you for these
to the sub-reports herewith enclosed. Casualties are as follows :
" Killed, 223, wounded, 394; missing, 1623; total, 2240. That our
loss was great, is true; yet that it was not much greater is due in an
eminent degree to the personal exertions of that model soldier. Col. W.
L. McMillen, of the 95th Ohio Infantry, who commanded the infantry,
and to the able commanders under him.
" The strength of the enemy is variously estimated by my most intel¬
ligent officers at from 15,000 to 20,000 men. A very intelligent sergeant
who was captured and remained five days in the haijds of the enemy,
reports the number of the enemy actually engaged, to have been 12,000,
and that two divisions of infantry were held in reserve. It may appear
strange that so large a force of the enemy could be in our vicinity and
we be ignorant of the fact, but the surprise will exist only in the minds
of those who are not familiar with the difficulty, (I may even say impos¬
sibility) of acquiring reliable information in the heart of the enemy's
country. Our movements and numbers are always known to the
enemy, because every woman and child is one of them, but we, as every¬
body knows who has had any experience in this war, can only learn the
movements of the enemy and his numbers by actually fighting for the
information; and in that case the knowledge often comes too late.
"While I will not prolong this already extended report by recording
individual acts of good conduct, and the names of many brave officers
