The Black Flag.

Belle Isle, states that for days at a time his wounds were not dressed,
and they had not been dressed for four days when he was taken from the
hospital and carried on the flag-of-truce boat for Fortress Monroe.
"In reference to the condition to which our men were reduced by cold
and hunger, your committee would call attention to the following ex-
extracts from the testimony. One witness testifies:
"' I had no blankets until our Government sent us some.
"' Question.—How did you sleep before you received those blanKets?
"'Answer.—We used to get together just as close as we could, and
sleep spoon-fashion, so that when one turned over we all had to turn
over.'
" Another witness testifies:
"' Question.—Were you hungry all the time?
" 'Answer.—Hungry I 1 could eat anything that came before us; some
of the boys would get boxes from the North with meat of different kinds
in them; and, after they had picked the meat off, they would throw the
bones away into the spit-boxes, and we would pick the bones out of the
epit-boxes and gnaw them over again.'
" In addition to this insufficient supply of food, clothing and shelter,
our soldiers, while prisoners, have been subjected to the most cruel treat¬
ment from those placed over them. They have been abused and shame¬
fully treated on almost every opportunity. Many have been mercilessly
shot and killed when they failed to comply with all the demands of
their jailors, sometimes for violating rules of which they had not been
informed. Crowded in great numbers in buildings, they have been fired
at and killed by the sentinels outside when they appeared at the win¬
dows for the purpose of obtaining a little fresh air. One man, whose
comrade in the service, in battle and in captivity, had been so fortunate
as to be among those released from further torments, was shot dead as
he was waving with his hand a last adieu to his friend; and other in¬
stances of equally unprovoked murder are disclosed by the testimony.
" The condition of our returned soldiers as regards personal cleanli¬
ness, has been filthy almost beyond description. Their clothes have been
so dirty and so covered with vermin, that those who received them have
been compelled to destroy their clothing and re-clothe them with new
and clean raiment. Their bodies and heads have been so infested with
vermin that, in some instances, repeated washings have failed to remove
them; and those who have received them in charge have been compelled
to cut all the hair from their heads, and make applications to destroy
the vermin. Some have been received with no clothing but shirts and
drawers and a piece of blanket or other outside covering, entirely desti¬
tute of coats, hats, shoes or stockings; and the bodies of those better
supplied with clothing have been equally dirty and filthy with the others,
many who have been sick and in the hospital having had no opportu.
nity to wash their bodies for weeks and months before they were released
from captivity.
"Your committee are unable to convey any adequate idea of the sad
and deplorable condition of the men they saw in the hospitals they
