thirty-two wounded. After this, the regiment returned to Fort Gibson
and went into camp, where it remained until the month of September,
when it again moved with the Division against the confederate force un- "
der General Cooper, who fled at our approach.
" After a pursuit of one hundred miles, and across the Canadian river
to Perryville, in the Choctaw Nation, all hopes of bringing them to an
engagement was abandoned, and the command returned to camp on the
site of the confederate Fort Davis, situated on the south side of the
Arkansas river, near its junction with Grand river.
"The regiment remained in this camp, doing but little duty, until
October, when orders were received to proceed to Fort Smith, where it
arrived during the same month. At this point it remained until Decem¬
ber 1st, making a march to Waldron and returning via Roseville, Arkan¬
sas, and in the same month went into winter quarters at the latter place,
situated fifty miles east of Fort Smith, on the Arkansas river. The
regiment remained at Roseville until March, 1864, when the command
moved to join the forces of Gen. Steele, then about starting on what was
known as the Camden Expedition. Joining Gen. Steele's command at
the Little Missouri river, distant twenty-two miles northeast of Wash¬
ington, Arkansas, the entire comrfiand moyed upon the enemy, posted
on the west side of Prairie de Anne, and within fifteen miles of Washing¬
ton. The enemy fled, and our forces occupied their works without an
engagement.
"The pursuit of the enemy in this direction was abandoned. The
command arrived at Camden on the 16th of April, 1864, and occupied
the place with its strong fortifications without opposition. On the day
following, Colonel Williams started with five hundred men of the 1st Col¬
orado, two hundred Cavalry, detailed from the 2nd, 6th and 14th, Kan¬
sas regiments, and one section, of the 2nd Indian Battery, with a train
to load forage and provisions at a point twenty miles west of Camden,
on the Washington road. On the 17t]ti he reached the place and suc¬
ceeded in loading about two-thirds of the train, which consisted of two
hundred wagons. At dawn the command moved towards Camden, and
loaded the balance of the wagons from plantations by the wayside. At
a point fourteen miles west of Camden the advance encountered a small
force of the enemy, who, after a slight skirmishing, retreated down the
road in such a manner as to lead Col. Williams to suspect that this
movement was a feint intended to cover other movements or to draw the
command into an ambuscade.
"Just previous to this he had been re-enforced by a detachment of
three hundred men of the 18th Iowa Infantry, and one hundred addi¬
tional cavalry, commanded by Capt. Duncan, of the 18th Iowa.
" In order to prevent any surprise, all detached foraging parties were
called in, and the original command placed in the advance, leaving the
rear in charge of Captain Duncan's command, with orders to keep flank¬
ers well out and to guard cautiously against a surprise. Colonel Will¬
iams at the front, with skirmishers and flankers well out, advanced cau-
