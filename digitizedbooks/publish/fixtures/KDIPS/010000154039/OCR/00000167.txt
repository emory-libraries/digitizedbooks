from Hunter spoiled the prettiest speech I had ever thought of making.
I had been delighted with Wickliffe's motion, and thought the reply to it
would furnish us first-rate Democrat's thunder for the next election. I
made up my mind to sail in against Hunter's answer—no matter what it
was—the moment it came; and to be even more humorously successful in
its delivery and reception than I was in my speech against War Horse
Gurley, of Ohio, which you have just been complimenting. Well, you
see, man proposes, but providence orders otherwise. When the Clerk
announced the receipt of the answer, and that he was about to read it, I
caught the Speaker's eye and was booked for the first speech against
your negro experiment. The first sentence, being formal and official,
was very well; but at the second the House began to grin, and at the
third, not a man on the floor—except Father Wickliffe, of Kentucky,
perhaps—who was not convulsed with laughter. Even my own risibles I
found to be affected; and before the document was concluded, I mo¬
tioned the Speaker that he might give the floor to whom he pleased, as
my desire to distinguish myself in that particular tilt was over.'"
