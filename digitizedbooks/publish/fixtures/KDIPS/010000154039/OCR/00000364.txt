History of the Black Phalanx.
brunt of the battle, and when finally the troops stam¬
peded, held the confederates in. check until the white
troops were beyond capture. But this was all they could
do, and this was indeed an heroic act.
The confederate says:
"Long before daylight found us moving rapidly to overtake the fly¬
ing foe. We had changed positions. The cavalry now being in advance,
overtook the enemy at Stubb's farm; a sharp skirmish ensued, when
they broke, leaving the remainder of their wagon train. Fourteen
pieces of artillery and some twenty-five ambulances, with a number of
wounded, were left in Little Hatchie bottom, further on. The discom¬
fited Federals were badly scattered throughout the country. Forrest,
therefore, threw out his regiment on either side of the roads to sweep the
vicinity. A number were killed and many prisoners captured before
reaching Ripley, twenty-five miles from Brice's Cross Roads. At this
point two strong lines were formed across the road. After a spirited
onset the Federals broke, leaving one piece of artillery, two caissons,
two ambulances. Twenty-one killed and seventy wounded were also left
on the field. Colonel G. M. McCraig, of the One Hundred and Twentieth
Illinois Infantry, was among the killed; also Captain W. J.Tate, Seventh
Tennessee Cavalry. This was accomplished just as the artillery reached
the front.
"Lieutenant Frank Rodgers, of Rucker's staff, the night previous,
with a small, select detachment of men, assisted by Captain Gooch, with
the remnant of his company1, hung constantly upon the Federal rear,
with a daring never surpassed. Their seiries of attacks greatly harrassed
and annoyed the enemy, numbers of whom were killed and wounded.
The artillery followed to Salem, twenty-five miles distant from Ripley."
The Phalanx regiments would not consent to be
whipped, even with the black flag flying in their front, and
deserted by their white comrades. A correspondent of the
Cleveland Leader, in giving an account of this "miserable
affair," writes:
"About sunrise, June 11, the enemy advanced on the town of Ripley,
and threatened our right, intending to cut us off from the Salem Road.
Again the colored troops were the only ones that could be brought into
line; the Fifty-ninth being on the right, and the Fifty-fifth on the left,
holding the streets. At this time, the men had not more than ten
rounds of ammunition, and the enemy were crowding closer and etill
closer, when the Fifty-ninth were ordered to charge on them, which they
did in good style, while singing,
"' We'll rally round the flag, boys.''
" This charge drove the enemy back, so thatboth regiments retreated
to a pine grove about two hundred yards distant.
