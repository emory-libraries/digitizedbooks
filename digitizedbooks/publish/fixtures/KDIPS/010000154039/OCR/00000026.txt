24:
History of the Black Phalanx.
The sincerity with, which this agreement was entered
into may be seen by the action of the colonists at Norfolk,
Virginia, where, in March, 1775, a brig arrived from the
coast of Guinea, via Jamaica, with a number of slaves
on board consigned to a merchant of that town. To use
a modern phrase the vessel was boycotted by the com¬
mittee, who published the following:
" TO THE FREEMEN OF VIRGINIA.
f Committee Chamber,
\Norfolk, March 6th, 1775.
"Trusting to your sure resentment against the enemies of your
country, we, the committee, elected by ballot for the Borough of Nor¬
folk, hold up for your just indignation Mr. John Brown, merchant, of
this place.
" On Thursday, the 2nd of March, this committee were informed of the
arrival of the brig Fanny, Capt. Watson, with a number of slaves for
Mr. Brown; and, upon inquiry, it appeared they were shipped from
Jamaica as his property, and on his account; that he had taken great
pains to conceal their arrival from the knowledge of the committee; and
that the shipper of the slaves, Mr. Brown's correspondent, and the cap¬
tain of the vessel, were all fully apprised of the Continental prohibition
against the article.
"From the whole of this transaction, therefore, wTe, the committee for-
Norfolk Borough, do give it as our unanimous opinion, that the said
John Brown has wilfully and perversely violated the Continental Asso¬
ciation, to which he had with his own hand subscribed obedience; and
that, agreeable to the eleventh article, we are bound, forthwith, to pub¬
lish the truth of the case, to the end that all such foes to the rights of
British America may be publicly known and universally contemned as
the enemies of American liberty, and that every person may henceforth
break off all dealings with him."
This was the voice of a majority of the colonists^ and
those who dissented were regarded as Tories, and in favor
of the crown as against the independence of the- colonies,
although there were many at the North and South who
held slaves, and were yet loyal to the cause of the colonies;
but the public sentiment was undoubtedly as strong
against the institution as it was in 1864. But the Tories
were numerous at the South, and by continually exciting
the imagination of the whites by picturing massacre and
insurrection on the part of the negros if they were armed,
thwarted the effort of Col. Lauren's and of Congress to
raise a "negro army" at the South. The leaders were
favorable to it, but the colonists, for the reason cited,
were distrustful of its practicability. Though a strong
effort was made, as will be seen, the scare raised by the
