The Army of the Frontier.

In front and on their flanks the enemy began massing
for a final onset. For five hours the Phalanx had fought
like tigers, against a ruthless foe, and though no black
flag warned them, they were not unmindful of the fate of
their comrades at Fort Pillow. General Dobbins was
evidently preparing to sweep the field. Several times al¬
ready had he sent his men to annihilate the blacks, and as
many times had they been repulsed. There was no time
for the Phalanx soldiers to manoeuvre; they were in the
closing jaws of death, and though they felt the day was
lost, their courage did not forsake them; it was indeed a
dreadful moment. The enemy was about to move upon

not follow the retreating column.
Two days later, Colonel Hudson, with all the available
men of the two Phalanx regiments,—60th, 56th and a de¬
tachment of the 3rd Phalanx artillery, with two cannons,
—went down the Mississippi and up the White river, dis¬
embarked and made a three days march across the coun¬
try, where the enemy was found entrenched. The Phalanx,
after a spirited contest, drove them out of their works,
burned their store, captured a few Texas rangers and
returned to Helena. In March, 1865, the 60th Regiment
was ordered to join Brig.-Gen. Reynolds' command at
Little Rock, where the regiment was brigaded with the
