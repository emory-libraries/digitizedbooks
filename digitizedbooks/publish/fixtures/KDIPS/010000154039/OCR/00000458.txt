History of the Black Phalanx.
obstructed our way, but as the obstruction began to cease an obstacle
in the shape of a long line of abattis met our gaze. The dusky line
broke through the abattis, however, as if the stakes had been so many
reeds, and charged over the breastworks and into the Confederate camp.
The rush must have been a surprise, as the enemy offered little resist¬
ance. In front of one of the tents a Federal sergeant (white) lay dead,
his right arm extended to the full length,'and firmly clenched in his hand
was a piece of fancy soap. A bullet had entered his forehead, the blood
from the wound was trickling down his face, but the hue of health was
still on his cheek. How he came to be there is to me a mystery, as that
part of the line was forced by colored troops. Swinging by the right
flank we kept our way along the Boydton road. A Confederate light
battery in position alongside of a cottage, which stood in a hollow,
shelled the column as it advanced, and so accurate had the gunners got
the range that almost every shell did damage. A couple of shells burst
together above my company. The flash blinded me for a few seconds.
I heard a scream of pain and just then was ordered to lie down. Not
twenty yards from me was a wounded soldier. His leg was shattered
badly. He prayed and sang hymns alternately, but his voice gradually
grew weaker until it ended in death. One of our batteries was brought
into position, and engaging the Confederate battery, the latter was
silenced, when the column again resumed the march, arriving in front of
Petersburg about noon.
"It was the intention of General Birney to carry by assault the main
fort which commanded the city, and he deployed the division in line of
battle for that purpose, but General Ord, coming up in time, ordered
him to retire his division out of range and await further orders. We
went into bivouac for the night, and at early dawn of the 3d we entered
the city, the Confederates having evacuated the forts during the night.
The field music played "John Brown's Body," and a tiny Union flag in
the hands of a girl of ten years waved us a welcome. Besting an hour
in the city the division started in pursuit of the Confederates. For a
mile or two outside of the city the road was strewn with plug tobacco.
Blood could be seen also at intervals in patches along the road. We
bivouacked some fifteen miles from the city. A few of our officers took
supper in a house close to our camping ground. Our fare was "corn
pone," scraps of bacon, sorghum molasses, and a solution of something
called coffee, for which we each gave our host, a middle-aged Virginian,
one dollar. The colored troops being encamped on his farm his indigna¬
tion was stirred and he exclaimed, while the tears trickled down his
cheeks, 'Poor old Virginia! poor old Virginia! that I should have lived
to see this day !'
"At dawn of the 4th the column resumed the pursuit. It is needless
for me to tell in detail hoVv our cavalry destroyed and burned over five
hundred Confederate wagons on the 5th and 6th, and how Ewell's com¬
mand was defeated and captured at Sailor's creek on the 6th. Our
brigade having arrived at Farmville on the afternoon of the 6th and
