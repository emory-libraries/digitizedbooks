CHAPTER XIV.
THE CONFEDERATE SERVICE.
The leaders at the South in preparing for hostilities
showed the people of the North, and the authorities at
Washington, that they intended to carry on the war with
no want of spirit; that every energy, every nerve, was to
be taxed to its utmost tension, a,nd that not only every
white man, but, if necessary, every black man should be
made to contribute to the success of the cause for which
the war was inaugurated. Consequently, with the enroll¬
ment of the whites began the employment of the blacks.
Prejudice against the negro at the North was so
strong that it required the arm of public authority to
protect him from assault, though he declared in fayor
of the Union. Not so at the South, for as early as April,
1861, the free negroes of New Orleans, La., held a public
meeting and began the organization of a battalion, with
officers of their own race, with the approval of the State
government, which commissioned their negro officers.
When the Louisiana militia was reviewed, the Native
Guards (negro) made up, in part, the first division of the
State troops. Elated at the success of being first to place
negroes in the field together with white troops, the com¬
manding general sent the news over the wires to the jubi¬
lant confederacy:
"New Orleans, Nov. 23rd, 1861.
"Over 28,000 troops were reviewed to-day by Governor Moore,
Major-General Lovell and Brigadier-General Buggies. The line was over
seven miles long; one regiment comprised 1,400 free colored men."
