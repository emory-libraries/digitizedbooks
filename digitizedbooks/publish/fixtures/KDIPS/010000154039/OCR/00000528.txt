ones unhurt. The whole regiment now fell back about 600 yards, in the
shelter of the woods. Six times we advanced, hoping to find some spot
where the men could cross, but in vain. We entered this fight with 1080
men, and lost 371 killed and 150 wounded; total loss, 421. The rebels
shelled us with their heavy guns, On our front were artillery and infan¬
try ; on our left a wooded ridge full of riflemen. We had two six-pound¬
ers ; one of them was dismounted early in the fight, and the other the
gunners ran out of range, it being of no use.
"Now, why were the colored troops left unsupported? Why were
they sent on such hopeless missions? Why were the officers informed
by General Dwight that there were clear grounds beyond Sandy Creek?
There were white troops who could have been sent to their support; the
officers expected to fight the rebels but met the river. Colonel Nelson
played General to perfection; during the whole battle he remained on
the safe side of Sandy Creek, and had his corps of orderlies to attend
him; in plain words he kept his men under fire from quarter before six
a. m. , till seven p. m. During the day he never saw a rebel's face or
back. * * * The heroes of the day were the men; not one of them
showed the "white feather." Colonel Bassett and his colored officers of
the 1st were as brave as any men who ever drew a sword, and so were
Finnegass, Lieutenant-Colonel of the 3rd, and Captains Smith, Daly,
Masterson and other®. Lieutenants O'Keefe, Burnham, Wiley, Griggs,
Emory, Westervelt and Dame of the 3rd, and Captain Quinn, who com¬
manded the left wing and led the storming column of the 3rd. Lieuten¬
ant-Colonel Bassett was formerly of the 4th Mississippi Regiment;
Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant-Colonel Finnegass, were both of Irish
parentage; Captain Daily and Lieutenant Emory,of the 31st Massachu¬
setts, Lieutenant O'Keefe of the 9th and Burnham, of the 13th Connec¬
ticut, Masterson and Wiley, of the 26th Massachusetts, Company A, of
the 3rd, were on detached service. Captain John E. Quinn is a native
of Lowell, Mftss.; born April 22nd, 1837 came from the 30th Massachu¬
setts, in which he was orderly of Company B.
A correspondent of the New York Tribune writing, says:
" The more I see of our colored regiments, and the more I converse
with our soldiers, the more convinced I am that upon them we must
ultimately rely as the principle source of our strength in these latitudes.
It is perfect nonsense for any one to attempt to talk away the broad
fact, evident as the sun at noonday, that these men are capable not only
of making good soldiers, but the very best of Boldiers. The Third
Louisiana Native Guard, Colonel Nelson, are encamped here, and a more
orderly, disciplined, robust, and effective set of men I defy any one to
produce.
"An old European officer, one who has followed the profession of
arms from his very boyhood, said to me to-day: 'In one essential
respect, sir, I believe that in a short time these colored soldiers will sur¬
pass any we have in our army—I mean in subordination—without which
no army can be effective. We are in the habit of carrying our citizenship
with us into the field, and that begets an amount of undue familiarity
between officers and men that is often destructive of obedience. Toward
the blac-k man we feel none of these delicate sentiments of equality, and
he, on his part, has always been accustomed to be commanded. Beside
this he is acclimated, knows the country thoroughly, and if called upon
to fight will fight in earnest, for he knows that if taken prisoner he will
meet no mercy.'
" Colonel Nelson, anxious to have an opportunity of exhibiting to
the world what his command is capable of, and thus put their manhood
beyond all question, has implored General Banks to put him in the fore-
