tery, arrived at the Station, and reported the confederates
in hot pursuit. Instantly the shattered, scattered troops
fled to the roads leading to Barber's, ten miles away, with
no one to command. Each man took his own route for
Barber's, leaving behind whatever would encumber him,—
arms, ammunition, knapsacks and cartridge boxes; many
of the latter containing forty rounds of cartridges. It was
long past midnight when Barber's was reached, and full
day before the frightened mob arrived at the Station. At
sunrise on the morning of the 21st, the scene presented at
Barber's was sickening and sad. The wounded lay every¬
where, upon the ground, huddled around the embers of
fagot tires, groaning and uttering cries of distress. The
surgeons were busy relieving, as best they could, the more
dangerously wounded. The foot-sore and hungry soldiers
sought out their bleeding and injured comrades and
placed them upon railroad flats, standing upon the tracks,
and when these were loaded, ropes and strong vines were
procured and fastened to the flats. Putting themselves
in the place of a locomotive,—several of which stood upon
the track at Jacksonville,•-—the mangled* and mutilated
forms of about three hundred soldiers were dragged for¬
ward mile after mile. Just in the rear, the confederates
kept up a fire of musketry, as though to hasten on the
stampede. It was well into the night when the train
reached Baldwin's, where it was thought the routed force
would occupy the extensive work encircling the station,
but they did not stop; their race was continued to Jack¬
sonville. At Baldwin's an agent of the Christian Commis¬
sion gave the wounded each two crackers, without water.
This over with, the train started for Jacksonville, ten
miles further. The camp of Colonel Beecher's command,
2nd Phalanx Regiment, was reached, and here coffee was
furnished. At daylight the train reached Jacksonville,
where the wounded were carried to the churches and cared
for. The battle and the retreat had destroyed every ves¬
tige of distinction based upon color. The troops during
the battle had fought together, as during the stampede
they had endured its horrors together.
