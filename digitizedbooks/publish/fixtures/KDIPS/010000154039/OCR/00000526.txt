from which death on the battle-field would have been a glorious relief.
The poor rights of a soldier were denied to them. Their actions were
narrowly watched, and the slightest faults severely commented upon.
In spite of all this the negro soldier fought willingly and bravely, and
with his rifle alone he has vindicated his manhood, and stands confessed
to-day as second in bravery to none.

DIARY OF THE THIRD REGIMENT DURING THE SIEGE OF
PORT HUDSON.
"May 1st, 1863.—Regiment broke camp at Fort William, Baton
Rouge, at 5 a. m. ; marched out of Bayou Monticino on the road to Port
Hudson. In the evening Company G, under Lieutenant Quinn, was
detailed for picket duty on the Clinton Road. Colonel promised to
encamp close by with the rest of the regiment, but instead of doing so
he fell back to the junction of the Clinton and Port Hudson Roads, thus
leaving the rebels a fifie chance to cross the bayou and cut off Company
G from all support. Lieutenant Quinn was doubtful of the colonel, and
to satisfy himself sent 2d Lieutenant Frederick Dame with twenty men
back to the woods to see how things were. Lieutenant Dame found that
Colonel Nelson had retreated back to Baton Rouge and reported. Lieu¬
tenant Quinn, feeling that if attacked dur^ig the night he would not
receive aid from the regiment, changed his position from the place
assigned in the woods by Colonel Nelson, to one 300 yards further down
in the woods, and on the road-side. He then threw out his pickets in all
directions, but only a short distance from the remainder of thecompany
who were held in reserve. Every man was on that night. Occasionally
horsemen were seen in the clearing, but as they did not appear to know
of our company's proximity the pickets did not fire on them.
" 12th.—Had a slight skirmish.
"13th.—Companies G and E, under Lieutenant Quinn, went on a
•reconnoissance; returned at midnight.
"14th.—All quiet in camp.
" 15th.—Fell back to Bayou Monticino.
" 16th.—Commenced to build a second bridge at Montibino Bayou.
"17th.—Company G, Lieutenant Dame, and Company E, Lieutenant
John Keefe, went on a scout under command of Lieutenant Quinn, cap¬
tured one horse, cattle, and had a skirmish with rebel pickets.
"18th.—Company G on picket ordered to block the road with felled
trees, connecting the Clinton and Bayou Sara roads, to prevent the rebel
cavalry and artillery getting in the rear of Dudley's brigade, who were
camped near Plains Store.
"19th.—Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Quinn rode to Dudley's
head-quarters. The regiment marched two miles nearer to Port Hud¬
son in the evening; were ordered back and bivouacked that night.
" 20th.—At 10 p. m. again for Port Hudson. After hours of hard
marching in heavy order in a hot sun on dusty roads and very little
water to drink, the regiment camped at dark in the left of the Union
line on the road leading to Springfield landing.
"21st.—Battle of Plains Store. During the morning there were
rumors of a fight, as the rebels were -deter mi n ed to prevent a junction of
of the force under Augur and Grover, of Banks' army, who were moving
down from St. Francis. This brought on the above-named battle, in
