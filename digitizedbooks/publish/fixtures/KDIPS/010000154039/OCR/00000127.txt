Recruiting and Organizing. 125
silch as had not been witnessed since the beginning of the
war became apparent. Many officers without commands,
and some with, but who sought promotion, wTere eager to
be allowed to organize a regiment, a battalion or a brig¬
ade of negro troops. Mr. Lincoln found it necessary in
less than six months after issuing his Proclamation of
Freedom, to put the whole matter of negro soldiers into
the hands of a board.* Ambition, as ambition will,
smothered many a white man's prejudice and caused more
than one West Pointer to forget his political education.
