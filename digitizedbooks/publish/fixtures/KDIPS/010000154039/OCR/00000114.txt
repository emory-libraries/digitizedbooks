History of the Black Phalanx.
lina; rumors were early afloat, when recruiting began,
that the government officers were gathering up the
negroes to ship away to Cuba, Africa and the West Indies.
These reports for a long time hindered the enlistment very
much. Then there was no large city for contrabands to
congregate in; besides they had no way of traveling from
island to island except on government vessels. Before the
Proclamation of freedom was issued, the city of Washing¬
ton, with Virginia and Maryland as additional territory
to recruit from, afforded an officer a better field to oper¬
ate in than any other point except New Orleans. The con¬
duct of the Government in revoking Gen. Fremont's Proc¬
lamation, and of McClellan's with the Army of the Poto¬
mac, in catching and returning escaped slaves, also had a
tendency for some time to keep back even the free negroes
of Virginia and Maryland. But this class of people never
enlisted to any great numbers, either before or after 1863,
and there finally came to be a general want of spirit with
them, while with the slave class there was a ready enthu¬
siasm to enlist. Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, was
Chairman of the Committee of Military Affairs, and
reported from that committee on the 8th of July 1862, a
bill authorizing the arming of negroes as a part of the
army. The bill finally passed both houses and received
the approval of the President on the 17th of July, 1862.
The battle for its success is as worthy of record as any
fought by the Phalanx. The debate was characterized by
eloquence and deep feeling on both sides. Says an account
of the proceedings in Henry Wilson's "Anti-slavery Meas¬
ures of Congress:
"Mr. Sherman (Rep.) of Ohio said, "The question aris6s, whether
the people of the United States, struggling for national existence,
should not employ these blacks for the maintenance of the Government.
The policy heretofore pursued by the officers of the United States has
been to repel this class of people from our lines, to refuse their services.
They would have made the best spies; and yet they have been driven from
our lines."—"I tell the President," said Mr. Fessenden (Rep.) of Maine,
"from my place here as a senator, I tell the generals* of our army, they
must reverse their practices and their course of proceeding on this sub¬
ject. * * I advise it here from my place,—treat your enemies as
