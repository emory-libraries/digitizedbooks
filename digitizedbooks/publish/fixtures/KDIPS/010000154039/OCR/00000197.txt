" 'I.—The Governor and Commander-in-Chief, relying implicitly upon the loyalty of
the free colored population of the city and State for the protection of their homes,
their property, and for Southern rights, from the pollution of a ruthless invader, and
believing that the military organization which existed prior to the 15th of February,
1862, and elicited praise and respect for the patriotic motives which prompted it,
Should exist for and during the war, calls upon them to maintain their organization,

"Now, therefore, the Commanding General, believing that a large portion of this
militia force of the State of Louisiana are willing to take s6rvice in the volunteer
forces of the United States, and be enrolled and organized to 'defend their homes from

outrage: to shield their property from being seized by bad men; and to defend the
flag of their native country as their fathers did under Jackson at Chalmette against
Packenham and his myrmidons, carrying the black flag of 'beauty and booty:*
"Appreciating their motives, relying upon their 'well-known loyalty and patriot-

members of the'Native Guards' aforesaid, and all other free colored citizens recog¬
nized by the first and late governor and authorities of the State of Louisiana as a por¬

States, shall be duly organized by the appointment of proper officers, and accepted,
paid, equipped, armed and rationed as are other volunteer troops of the United States,

Notwithstanding the harsh treatment they had been
receiving from Military-Governor Shepley and the Pro¬
vost Guard, the rendezvous designated was the scene of a
busy throng the next day. Thousands of men were enlis¬
ted during the first week, and in fourteen days a regi¬
ment was organized. The first regiment's line officers were
colored, and the field officers were white. Those who
made up this regiment were not all free negroes by more
than half. Any negro who would swear that he was free,
if physically good, was accepted, and of the many thou¬
