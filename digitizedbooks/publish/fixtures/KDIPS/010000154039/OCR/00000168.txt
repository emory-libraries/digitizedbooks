History of the Black Phalanx.
CHAPTER IT.
OFFICERS OF THE PHALANX.
The character, qualifications and proficiency of the
men, who, as officers, commanded the negro troops, may
be judged by the process which they had to undergo in
order to obtain commissions. Unlike the officers of the
white volunteers (with whom loyalty and dash were the
essential qualifications) they were required to possess
much more than an ordinary knowledge of military tac¬
tics. Major-General Hunter,by whose order the first ne- to
regiment with white officers was organized, commencing
May, 1862, had an eye single to the make up of the men
who should be placed in command of the regiments. As a
beginning, Gen. Saxton addressed the following letter to
Capt.T.W. Higginson, of the 51st Reg't. Mass. Volunteers,
Beaufort, S. C., Nov. 5th, 1862:
" My Dear Sir :—I am organizing the First Regiment of South Caro¬
lina Volunteers, with every prospect of success. Your name has been
gpoken of in connection with the command of this regiment, by some
friends in whose judgment I have confidence. I take great pleasure in
offering you the position of Col. in it, and hope that you may be induced
to accept. I shall not fill the place until I hear from you, or sufficient
time shall have passed for me to receive your reply. Should you accept
I enclose a pass for Port Royal, of which I trust you will feel disposed to
avail yourself at once. I am, with sincere regard,
Yours truly,
R. Saxton,
Brig. Gen., Mil. Gov.'*
This was an excellent selection, and Captain Higgin-
son's acceptance rather assured a fair trial for the men
who should compose this regiment, as well as the quality
of its officers.
