abled, through the patriotic efforts of Governor Crawford,
of Kansas, who is also ex-Colonel of the 2nd Kansas Reg¬
iment, to find Mr. J. B. McAfee, late chaplain of the same
regiment and Adjutant-General of Kansas, now engaged
in business in Topeka. With the finding of Mr. McAfee
came another difficulty; the report of the Adjutant-Gen¬
eral, containing an account of the regiments in the war,
had been accidentaly burned before leaving the printing
office. This difficulty was overcome, however, by the con¬
sideration ever shown the negro by Mr. McAfee, who kindly
loaned his only volume of the "Military History of Kan¬

The service rendered by the Phalanx soldiery of Kan¬
sas stands second to none upon the records of that State.
Their patriotism was nothing less than a fitting return
for the love of liberty shown by the Free State men in res¬

discussions at the national capitol pointed Kansas out to
the negro as a place where he might enjoy freedom in com¬

as he does now,* the acme of Republican States. Those
negroes who enjoyed and appreciated the sentiment that
made her so, were determined as far as they were able, to
stand by the men who had thus enlarged the area of free¬
dom.
Without comment upon the bravery of these troops,
the report is submitted of their conduct in camp, field,
on the march and in battle, as made by those who com¬
manded them on various occasions.
"On the 4th day of August, 3862, Captain James M. Williams, Co.
F, 5th Kansas Cavalry, was appointed by Hon. James H. Lane, Recruit¬
ing Commissioner for that portion of Kansas lying north of the Kansas
River, for the purpose of recruiting and organizing a regiment of infan¬
try for the United States service, to be composed of men of African
descent* He immediately commenced the work of recruiting by securing
the muster-in of recruiting officers with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, and
by procuring supplies from the Ordauce Quartermaster and Commissary
* Not less than 70,000 negroes—5,000 at least of which fouprht for the Union,—have
been driven by persecution into Kansas from the Southern States, aid the exodus still
continues.
