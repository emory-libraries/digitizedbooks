lull in the engagement (for I had been hearing sharp firing in front), I
greatly feared* that Forrest was defeated and that the Federals were
pushing him back, so I moved rapidly down the road till I reached the
open field near the bridge.'
"This could not have been the Ripley Guntownroad, as that road
was filled with Federal troops, wagons and artillery from Dr. Agnew's
house to the cross roads, a distance of two miles. ' Having placed some
sharpshooters, whose sole attention was to be directed to the bridge,' he
continues, ' I extended my line nearly half a mile, and began an attack
by scattering shots at the same time. Sounding my bugle from various
points along the line, almost immediately a reconnoitering force of the
enemy appeared at the bridge, and being fired upon returned. This was
followed, perhaps, by a regiment, and then a whole brigade came down
to the creek. My, men, taking good aim, fired upon them coolly and
steady. Soon I saw wagons, artillery, etc., pushing for the bridge.
These were shot at by my sharpshooters, 1 now began to contract my
line and collect my regiment, for the Federals came pouring in immense
numbers across the creek. Your artillery was doing good work. Even
the bullets from the small arms of the Confederates reached my men. I
operated upon the flank of the enemy until after dark.'
"The wagons blockading the bridge were soon removed by being
thrown into the stream and a section from each battery was worked
across by hand, supported by the escort, and brought to bear upon a
negro brigade with fearful loss; the other two sections were quickly to
the front, ahead of any support for the moment, and drove the enemy
from the ridge back of Holland's house across Dry creek. The cavalry
in the meantime had halted, reorganized and soon joined in the pursuit.
The road was narrow, with dense woods on each side, so that it was im¬
possible to use more than four pieces at a time, but that number were
kept close upon the heels of the retreating enemy and a murderous fire
prevented them from forming to make a stand.
"The ridge extending southward from the Hadden house offered a
strong natural position for defensive operations. Upon this ridge the
Federals had established a line of battle, but a few well directed shots
from the artillery stationed near the Holland house and a charge by our
cavalry across Dry creek readily put them to flight. A section of each
battery was ordered at a gallop to this ridge, which was reached in time
to open with a few rounds of double-shotted cannister upon their demor¬
alized ranks as they hastily retreated through the open fields on either
side of Phillips branch. Our cannoneers were greatly blown and well
nigh exhausted from excessive heat and continuous labor at their guns
for full five hours. "We noticed a number drink with apparant relish the
black powder water from the sponge buckets."
The enemy followed the fleeing column, capturing and
wounding many at the town of Eipley. Next morning the
Federals made a stand. Again the Phalanx bore the
