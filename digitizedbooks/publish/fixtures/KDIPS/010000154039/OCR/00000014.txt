Preface.
search and appeal,—I can but feel that it has been thoroughly done. The
public libraries of the cities of Boston, Cincinnati, New Bedford, New
York, the War Department at Washington, and the private libraries
of several eminent citizens, have alike been made use of by me.
It seemed proper, also, that the memory of our forefathers should
not be allowed to remain in longer obscurity; that it was fitting to
recall their deeds of heroism, that all might know the sacrifices they
made for the freedom their descendants were so long denied from enjoy¬
ing. In gathering together the scattered facts relating to the negroe's
participation in the wars of 1775 and 1812, difficulties well-nigh insur¬
mountable have been over-come, and it has been only through patient
and persistent effort that I have been able to prepare the chapters de¬
voted to the early wars of the United States.
Descriptions of a number of the battles in which negro troops took
part in the late war of the Rebellion, are given to call attention to the
unsurpassed carnage which occurred, and to give them proper place in
the war's history rather than to present a critical account of the battles.
My aim has been to write in the spirit which impelled the soldiers to go
forth to battle, and to reverse the accounts given in the popular histories
which ascribe to the generals and colonels who commanded, instead of the
soldiers who did the fighting, victory or defeat. " The troops who do
what can neither be expected nor required, are the ones which are victo¬
rious. The men, who, tired and worn and hungry and exhausted, yet
push into battle, are those who win. They who persist against odds,
against obstacles, against hope, who proceed or hold out reasonably, are
the conquerors," says Gen. Grant's historian. With no desire of detract¬
ing from the commanders—if I were able—the honor due them, my aim
is to credit the soldiers with whatever heroism they may have displayed.
I acknowledge it has been a labor of love to fight many of the bat¬
tles of the war of the rebellion over again, not because of a relish for
blood and the destruction of human life, but for the memories of the
past; of the bondage of a race and its struggle for freedom, awakening
as they do the intense love of country and liberty, such as one who has
been without either feels, when both have been secured by heroic effort.
To those who have responded to my appeal for information regard¬
ing the negro soldier, I have aimed to give full credit; if any are omitted
it is not intentionally done. To no one am I more indebted for assisting
in collecting data, than to Lt. J. M. Trotter, of the 55th Mass. Reg't.
nor am I unmindful of the kindness of Hon. Robert Lincoln, late Secre¬
tary of War, nor that of Col. James D. Brady, member of Congress from
Virginia, for copies of public records; to Col. H. C. Corbin, for the record
of the 14th Regt.; and to Col. D. Torrance for that of the 29th Reg't.
Qonn. I am also indebted to Maj. Gen. Wm. Mahone for a map of the
defences of Petersburg, showing the crater; to the librarian of the
.Young Men's Mercantile Library, of Cincinnati, for the use of Col.
Albert's carved map of Fort Wagner, and to Col. G.M. Arnold and Hon.
Joseph Jergenson for copies of historical papers; also to Hon. Libbey.
