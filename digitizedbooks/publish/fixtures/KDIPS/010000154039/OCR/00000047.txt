"Lord Dvnmore to the Secretary of State.
/Ship 'Dunmore,' in Elizabeth River, Va., •
\ 30th March, 1776.
"Your Lordship will observe by my letter, No. 34, that I have been
endeavoring to raise two regiments here— one of white people, the other
of black. The former goes on very slowly, but the latter very well, and

whistle did the boy in the woods; they talked in that way
simply to keep their courage up, and their conscience
down.
The commander of the American army regarded the
action of Lord Dunmore as a serious blow to the national
cause. To take the negroes out of the field from raising
