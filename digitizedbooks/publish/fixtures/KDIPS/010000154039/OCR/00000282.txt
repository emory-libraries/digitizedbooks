History of the Black Phalanx.
"arrogant" Wagner, the following circular was addressed
to the subordinate engineers for information regarding
the negro troops, which drew forth explicit and interesting
answers:
"COLORED TROOPS FOR WORK.—CIRCULAR.
"Headquarters Department op the South,
"Engineer's Office, Morris' Island, S. C., Sept. 10th, 1863.
"As the important experiment which will test the fitness of the American negro for
the duties of a soldier is now being tried, it is desirable that facts bearing on the ques¬
tion be carefully observed and recorded.
" It is probable that in no military operations of the war have negro troops don©
bo large a proportion, and so important and hazardous, fatigue duty, as in the siege
operations oh this island.
" As you have directed the operations of working parties of both white and black
troops here, I respectfully ask, for the object above stated, an impartial and carefully-
prepared answer to the following inquiries, together with such statements as yoa
choose to make bearing on this question:
"I. Courage as indicated by their behavior under Are.
" II. Skill and appreciation of their duties, referring to the quality of the work
performed.
" III. Industry and perseverence, with reference, to the quantity of the work per¬
formed.
" IV. If a certain work were to be accomplished in the least possible time, 1. e.,
•when enthusiasm and direct personal interest is necessary to attain the end, would
whites or blacks answer best ?
"V. What is the difference, considering the above points between colored troopa
recruited from the free States and those from the slave States ?
"Very respectfully your obedient sewvant,
"T. B. BROOKS,
Major, Aide-de-Camp and Ass't Engineer."
Six replies to these enquiries were received from engi¬
neer officers who had been engaged in the siege, the sub¬
stance of which is embraced in the following summary, fol¬
lowing which two replies are given in full,
" 1. To the first question all answer that the black is more timorous
than the white, but is in a corresponding degree more do^le and obedi¬
ent, hence more completely under the control of his commander, and
much more influenced by his example.
"2. . All agree that the black is less skillful than the white soldier,
but still enough so for most kinds of siege work.
"3. The statements unanimously agree that the black will do a
greater amount of work than the white soldier because he labors mors
constantly.
"4. The whites are decidedly superior in enthusiasm. The blacks
cannot be easily hurried in their work, no matter what the emergency.
" 5. All agree that the colored troops recruited from free States are
superior to those recruited from slave States.
"It may with propriety be repeated here, that the average percent¬
age of sick aipong the negro troops during the siege was 13.9, while that
of the white infantry was 20.1 per cent.
" The percentage of tours of duty performed by the blacks as com¬
pared with the white infantry, was as 56 to 41. But the grand guard
duty, which was considered much more wearing than fatigue, was all
done by the whites.
