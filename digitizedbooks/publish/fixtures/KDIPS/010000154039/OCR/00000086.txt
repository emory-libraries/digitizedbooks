B4 History of the Black Phalanx.
The forcible capture and imprisonment of "Ware, Mar.
tin and Strachan, the three negroes taken from the Chesa¬
peake, and who were recognized by the United States au¬
thorities as citizens of the republic, was sounded as the
key-note and rallying cry of the war; the outrage served
greatly to arouse the people. The fact that the govern¬
ment sought to establish the liberty of the free negroes,
and the further fact that she regarded them as citizens,
heightened their indignation at the outrage committed by
bhe British, and appealed to their keenest patriotic sensi¬
bilities. New York was not long in raising her two battal¬
ions, and sending it forward to the army, then at Sack-
et's Harbor.

of his Proclamation, Gen. Jackson reviewed the troops
under his command at New Orleans, amounting to about
six thousand, and of this force about five hundred were

Jackson's staff, the following address, from the Com¬
mander of the American forces:

General commanding in chief would not do justice to the noble ardor

aut public notice. *****
"Fellow-citizens, of every description, remember for what and
against whom you contend. For all that can render life desirable—for a
country blessed with every gift of nature—for property, for life—for
bhose dearer than either, your wives and children—and for liberty, with-
Dut which, country, life, property, are no longer worth possessing; as
jven the embraces of wives and children become a reproach to the wretch
[vho could deprive them by his cowardice of those invaluable blessings.

"To the Men op Color.—Soldiers! From the shores of Mobile I
jollected you to arms,—I invited you to share in the perils and to
livide the glory of your white countrymen. I expected much from you;
"or I was not uninformed of those qualities which must render you so
formidable to an invading foe. I knew that you could endure hunger
