316 History of the Black Phalanx.
" I feel no inclination to retaliate for offences of irresponsible persons,
but, if it is the policy of any general intrusted with the command of
troops, to show no quarter, or to punish with death, prisoners taken in
battle, I will accept the issue. It may be you propose a different line of
policy to black troops, and officers commanding them, to that practiced
"toward white troops. If so, I can assure you that these colored troops
are regularly mustered into the service of the United States. The gov¬
ernment, and all officers under the government, are bound to give the
same protection to these troops that they do to any other troops."
General Taylor replied that he would punish all such
acts, "disgraceful alike to humanity and the reputation
of soldiers," but declared that officers of the "Confederate
Army" were required to turn over to the civil authorities,
to be dealt with according to the laws of the State where¬
in such were captured, all negroes taken in arms.
As early as December, 1862, incensed by General But¬
ler's administration at New Orleans in the arming of
negroes, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate
Government, issued the following proclamation:
"First.—That all commissioned officers in the command of said Benjamin F. But¬
ler be declared not entitled to be considered as soldiers engaged in honorable warfare,
but as robbers and criminals, deserving death; and that they, and each of them, be,
•whenever captured, reserved for execution.
"Second.—That the private soldiers and non-commissioned officers in the army of
•said Benj. F. Butler, be considered a8 only instruments used for the commission of
crimes, perpetrated by his orders, and not as free agents; that they, therefore, bo
treated when captured as prisoners of war, with kindness and humanity, and be sent
home on the usual parole; that they will in no manner aid or serve the United States in.
any capacity during the continuance of war, unless duly exchanged.
"Third.—That all negro slaves captured in arms be at once delivered over to the
executive authorities, of the respective States to which they belong, and to be dealt
with according to the laws of said States.
"Fourth.—That the like orders be executed in all cases with respect to all com¬
missioned officers of the United States when found serving in company with said slaves
in insurrection against the authorities of the different States of this Confederacy.
Signed and sealed at Richmond, Dec. 23, 1862.
JEFFERSON DAVIS."
This Proclamation was the hoisting of the black flag
against the Phalanx, by which Mr. Davis expected to
bring about a war of extermination against the negro
soldiers.*
In his third annual message to the Confederate Con¬
gress, Mr. Davis said:
"We may well leave it to the instincts of that common humanity
which a beneficient creator has implanted in the breasts of our fellow
* Among the captured rebel flags now in the War Department, Washington, D. C.,
are several Black Flags. No. 205 was captured near North Mountain, Md., Aug 1st,
1864. Another Captured from General Pillow's men at Fort Donelson, is also among
the rebel archives in that Department. Several of them were destroyed by the troops
capturing them, as at Pascagoula, Miss., and near Grand Gull on the Mississippi.
