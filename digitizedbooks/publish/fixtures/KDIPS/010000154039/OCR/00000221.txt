eral Banks was justified in according a special commenda¬
tion to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments, and to the 1st
Engineer Regiment, of the Phalanx, saying, "No troops
could be more determined or daring." The 1st lost its
Cailloux, the 2nd its Paine, but the Phalanx won honor
for the race it represented. No higher encomium could be
paid a regiment than that awarded the gallant 2nd by
the poet Boker :
"THE BLACK REGIMENT, OB THE SECOND LOUISIANA AT THE STORMING
OF PORT HUDSON.
In the #tin's mouth they laugh;
Or at the slippery brands
Leaping with open hands,
Down they tear, man and horse,
Down in their awful course;
Trampling with bloody heel
Over the crashing steel.
All their eyes forward bent,
Rushed the Black Regiment.^
' Freedom!' their gallant cry,
'FreedomI or live or die! '
Ah! and they meant the word.
Not as with us its heard,
Nor a mere party shout,
They gave their spirits out;
Trusted the end to God,
And on the gory sod
Rolled in triumphant blood,
Glad to strike one free blotv,
Whether for weal or woe;
Glad to breathe one free breath.
Though on the lips of death
Praying—alas! in vain!
That they might fall again.
So they could once more see
That burst of liberty!
This was what 'Freedom' lent
To the Black Regiment.
Hundreds on hundreds fell ;|
But they are resting well;
Scourges and shackles strong
'Charge!' trump and drum awoke; Never shall do them wrong.
Onward the bondmen broke Oh! to the living few,
Bayonet and sabre stroke Soldiers, be just and true!
Vainly opposed their rush Hail them as comrades tried;1
Through the wild battle's crush, Fight with them side by side;,
With but one thought aflush, Never in field or tent ,
Driving their lords like chaff, Scorn the Black Regiment."
Dark as the clouds of even,
Banked in the western heaven,
Waiting the breath that lifts
All the dread mass, and drifts
Tempest and falling brand,
Over a ruined land—
So still and orderly
Arm to arm, and knee to knee
Waiting the great event,
Stands the Black Regiment.
Down the long dusky line
Teeth gleam and eyeballs shine;
And the bright bayonet,
Bristling and firmly set.
Flashed with a purpose grand,
Long ere the sharp command
Of the fierce rolling drum
Told them their time had come—
Told them what work was sent
For the Black Regiment.
•Now,' the flag sergeant cried,
' Though death and hell betide,
Let the whole nation see
If we are fit to be,
Free in this land; or bound
Down like the whining hound—
Bound with red stripes of pain
In our old chains again!'
Oh! what a shout there went
From the Black Regiment.
