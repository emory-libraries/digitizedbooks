fires at home, they burned up every stick the first night, to the quarter¬
master's great consternation.
"To return: On the morning of December 15th, Major Lewis said
he would have a servant bring me my breakfast, which was not ready,
however, when I started. The boy, with an eye to safety, followed me
afar off, so far that he only reached me, I think, about two o'clock in the
afternoon. But 1 really believe the delay, improved the flavor of the
breakfast.
"As soon as the fog lifted, the battle began in good earnest. Hood
mistook my assault for an attack in force upon his right flank, and
weakening his left in order to meet it, gave the coveted opportunity to
Thomas, who improved it by assailing Hood's left flank, doubling it up,
and capturing a large number of prisoners.
" Thus the first day's fight wore away. It had been for us a severe
but glorious day. Over three hundred of my command had fallen, but
everywhere our army was successful. Victory perched upon our banners.
Hood had stubbornly resisted, but had been gallantly driven back with
severe loss. The left had done its duty. General Steadman congratu¬
lated us, saying his only fear had been that we might fight too hard.
"We had done all he desired, and more. Colored soldiers had again
fought side by side with white troops; they had mingled together in
the charge; they had supported each other; they had assisted each other
from the field when wounded, and they lay side by side in death. The
survivors rejoiced together over a hard fought field, won by a common
valor. All who witnessed their conduct, gave them equal praise. The
day that we had longed to see had come and gone, and the sun went
down upon a record of coolness, bravery, manliness, never to be unmade.
A new chapter in the history of liberty had been written. It had been
shown that, marching under a flag of freedom, animated by a love of
liberty, even the slave becomes a man and a hero.
"At one time during the day, while the battle was in progress, I sat
in an exposed place on a piece of ground sloping down toward the
enemy, and being the only horseman on that part of the field, soon be¬
came a target for the balls that whistled and sang their threatening
songs as they hurried by. At length a shot aimed at me struck my
horse in the face, just above the nostril, and passing up under the skin
emerged near the eye, doing the horse only temporary harm, and letting
me off scot-free, much to my satisfaction, as may be supposed. Captain
Baker, lying on the ground near by, heard the thud of the ball as it
struck the horse, and seeing me suddenly dismount, cried out, 'the Colo¬
nel is shot,' and sprang to my side, glad enough to find that the poor
horse's face had been a shield to save my life. I was sorry that the ani¬
mal could not appreciate the gratitude I felt to it for my deliverance.
" During that night Hood withdrew his army some two miles, and
took up a new line along the crest of some low hills, which he strongly
fortified with some improvised breast works and abatis. Soon after our
early breakfast, we moved forward over the intervening space. My posi-
