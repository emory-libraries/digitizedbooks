Public Opinion.

Wickliffe, of Kentucky; Salisbury, of Delaware, and others
in Congress.
Public opinion was now changed, Congress had pro¬
hibited the surrender of negroes to the rebels, the Presi¬
dent issued his Emancipation Proclamation, and more
than 150,000 negroes were fighting for the Union. The
Republican party met in convention at Chicago, and
nominated Mr. Lincoln for the second term as President
of the United States; the course of his first administra¬
tion was now to be approved or rejected by the people.
In the resolutions adopted, the fifth one of them related to
Emancipation and the negro soldiers. It was endorsed
by a very large majority of the voters. A writer in one
of the magazines, prior to the election,,thus reviews the
resolutions:
"The fifth resolution commits us to the approval of two meas¬
ures that have aroused the most various and strenuous opposition, the
Proclamation of Emancipation and the use of negro troops. In refer¬
ence to the first, it is to be remembered that it is a war measure. The
expresss language of it is: 'By virtue of the power in me vested as
commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States in time
of actual armed rebellion against the authority and Government of the
United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing
said rebellion.' Considered thus, the Proclamation is not merely defensi¬

rebellion which every person desiring its speedy overthrow must
zealously and perforce uphold. Whether it is of any legal effect beyond
the actual limits of our military lines, is a question that need not agitate
us. In due time the supreme tribunal of the nation will be called to
determine that, And to its decision the country will yield with all respect
and loyalty. But in the mean time let the Proclamation go wherever
the army goes, let it go wherever the navy secures a foothold on the
outer border of the rebel territory, and let it summon to our aid the
negroes who are truer to the Union than their disloyal masters; and
when they have come to us and put their lives in our keeping, let us pro¬
tect and defend them with the whole power of the nation. Is there any¬
thing unconstitutional in that? Thank God, there is not. And he who
is willing to give back to slavery a single person who has heard the
summons and come within our lines to obtain his freedom, he who
would give up a single man, woman, or child, once thus actually freed, is
not worthy the name of American. He may call himself Confederate, if
he will.
"Let it be remembered, also that the Proclamation has had a very
