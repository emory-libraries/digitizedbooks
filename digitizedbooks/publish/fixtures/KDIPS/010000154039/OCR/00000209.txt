sick at heart, than when T saw how my brave soldiers had been slaughtered,—one with
81X- wounds, all the rest with two or three, none less than two wounds. Two of my col¬
ored sergeants were killed; both brave, noble men, always prompt, vigilant, and ready
for the fray. I never more wish to hear the expression, 'The niggers wont fight.'
Come with me, a hundred yards from where I sit, and I can show you the wounds that
cover the bodies of sixteen as brave, loyal, and patriotic soldiers as ever drew bead on
a rebel.
"The enemy charged us so close that we fought with our bayonets, hand to hand.
I have six broken bayonets to show bow bravely my men fought. The Twenty-third
Iowa joined my company on the right; and I declare truthfully that they had all fled
before our regiment fell back, as we were all compelled to do.
"Under command of Col. Page, lied the Ninth and Eleventh l-iouisiana when the
rifle-pits were retaken and held by our troops, our two regiments doing the work.
"1 narrowly escaped death once. A rebel took deliberate aim at me with both bap
rels of his gun ; and the bullets passed so close to me that the powder that remained on
them burnt my cheek. Three of my men, who saw him aim and fire, thought that b<*
wounded me each fire; One of them was killed by my side, and he fell on me, covering
my clothes with his blood; and, before the rebel could fire again, I blew his brains out
with my gun.
"It was a horrible fight, the worst I was ever engaged in,—not even excepting Shi-
loh. The enemy cried, ' No quarter!' but some of them were very glad to take it when
made prisoners.
"Col. Allen, of the Sixteenth Texas, was killed in front of our regiment, and Brig.-
Gen. Walker was wounded. We killed about one hundred and eighty of the enemy.
The gunboat "Choctaw" did good service shelling them. T stood on the breastworks
after we took them, and gave the elevations and direction for the gunboat by pointing
my sword; and they sent a shell right into their midst, which sent them in all directions.
Three shells fell there, and sixty-two rebels lay there when the fight was over.

"This battle satisfied the slave-masters of the South that their charm was gone;
and that the negro as a slave, was lost forever. Yet there was one fact connected with
the battle of Milliken's Bend which will descend to posterity, as testimony against the
humanity of slave-holders; and that is, that no negro was ever found alive that was
taken a prisoner by the rebels in this fight."
The Department of the Gulf contained a far greater
proportion of the Phalanx than did any other Depart¬
ment, and there were very few, if any, important engage¬
ments fought in this Department in which the Phalanx
did not take part.
It is unpleasant here, in view of the -valuable services
rendered by the Phalanx, to be obliged to record that the
black soldiers were subjected to many indignities, and suf¬
fered much at the hands of their white "fellow comrades in
arms. Repeated assaults and outrages were committed
upon black men wearing the United States' uniform, not
only by volunteers but conscripts from the various States,
and frequently by confederate prisoners who had been pa¬
roled by the United States; these outrages were allowed to
take place, without interference by the commanding offi¬
cers, who apparently did not observe what was going on.
At Ship Island, Miss., there were three companies of
the 13th Maine, General Neal Dow's old regiment, and
seven companies of the 2nd Regiment Phalanx, comman¬
ded by Colonel Daniels, which constituted the garrison at
that point. Ship Island was the key to New Orleans. On
