while our mortars in the rear tossed their bombs over their heads. The
Fifty-fourth Massachusetts [Phalanx Regiment] led the attack, sup¬
ported by the 6th Conn., 48th N. Y., 3rd N. H., 76th Penn. and the 9th
Maine Regiments. Onward swept the immense mass of men, swiftly and
silently, in the dark shadows of night. Not a flash of light was seen in
the distance! No sentinel hoarsely challenged the approaching foe! All
was still save the footsteps of the soldiers, which sounded like the roar
of the distant surf, as it beats upon the rock-bound coast.
"Ah, what is this! The silent and shattered walls of "Wagner all at
once burst forth into a blinding sheet of vivid light, as though they had
suddenly been transformed by some magic power into the living, seeth-f
ing crater of a volcano! Down came the whirlwind of destruction along
the beach with the swiftness of lightning! How fearfully the hissing
shot, the shrieking bombs, the whistling bars of iron, and the whispering
bullet struck and crushed through the dense masses of our brave men! I
never shall forget the terrible sound of that awful blast of death, which
swept down, shattered or dead, a thousand of our men. Not a shot had
missed its aim. Every bolt of steel, every globe of iron and lead, tasted
of human blood.
"'Forward!' shouted the undaunted Putnam, as the column wa¬
vered and staggered like a giant stricken with death.
"' Steady, my boys!' murmured the brave leader, General Strong, as
a cannon-shot dashed him, maimed and bleeding, into the sand.
"In a moment the column recovered itself, like a gallant ship at sea
when buried for an instant under an immense wave.
" The ditch is reached; a thousand men leap into it, clamber up the
shattered ramparts, and grapple with the foe, which yields and falls back
to the rear of the fort. Our men swarm over the walls, bayoneting the
desperate rebel cannoneers. Hurrah! the fort is ours!
"But now came another blinding blast from concealed guns in the
rear of the fort, and our men went down by scores. Now the rebels rally,
and, re-enforced by thousands of the chivalry, who have landed on the
beach under cover of darkness, unmolested by the guns of the fleet.
They hurl themselves with fury upon the remnant of our brave band.
The struggle is terrific. Our supports hurry up to the aid of their com¬
rades, but as they reach the ramparts they fire a volley which strikes
down many of our men. Fatal mistake! Our men rally once more;
but, in spite of an heroic resistance, they are forced back again to the
edge of the ditch. Here the brave Shaw, with scores of his black war-
riers, went down, fighting desperately. Here Putnam met his death
wound, while cheering and urging on the overpowered Phalanx men.
"What fighting, and what fearful carnage! Hand to hand, breast
to breast! Here, on this little strip of land, scarce bigger than the hu¬
man hand, dense masses of men struggled with fury in the darkness; and
so fierce was the contest that the sands were reddened and soaked with
human gore.
" But resistance was vain. The assailants were forced back again to
