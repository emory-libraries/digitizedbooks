were consolidated and formed the Twenty-fourth Corps, under Gen.
Foster; and the colored troops of the Ninth, Tenth and Eighteenth
Corps, with other colored troops not assigned, formed the Twenty-fifth
Corps, under Gen. Weitzel. Its three divisions were commanded by
Gens. Wild, Birney and Paine, respectively. The First Brigade of Bir*
ney's division was made up of the Seventh, One Hundred and Ninth,
One Hundred and Sixteenth and One hundred and Seventeenth, under
Col. Shaw. The Forty-first Forty-fifth and One Hundred and Twenty-
seventh had at different times been attached to the brigade—to learn

Hundred and Fifteenth was substituted for the One Hundred and Seven¬
teenth in the brigade.
" On the 4th, a general re-assignment of positions was made, The
Seventh moved from the New Market road to Fort Burnham (Harri¬

closer, at every opportunity, to the beleaguered cities,
until they were well-nigh completely invested. General
Sherman's splendid victories influenced the veteran corps
lying before these places, and filled them with the spirit of
sure success. The intrepid commander, having reached
North Carolina, visited Grant at the latter's headquarters
at City Point, where he also found President Lincoln, and
received their congratulations for his successful march to
the sea, which achievement had not been surpassed by
any of the undertakings of either Hannibal or Bonaparte
in point of daring and strategy. An important confer¬
ence then took place, and on the 28th of March Sherman
returned to his command.
Grant throughout the winter had, been preparing for
the spring campaign. The Phalanx regiments heretofore
in the 9th, 10th and 18th Corps had been consolidated,
and formed the 25th Corps, under the command of Major-
General Godfrey Weitzel, who at New Orleans refused to
command negro troops. The Corps was divided into
