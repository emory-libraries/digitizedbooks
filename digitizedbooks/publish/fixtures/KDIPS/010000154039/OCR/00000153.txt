sibility of sustaining the organization, or give such orders as would
absolve Gen. Hunter from the responsibility of backing out from an ex¬
periment which he believed to be essential to the salvation of the coun¬
try,—all these appeals to Washington proved in vain; for the oracles still
remained profoundly silent, probably waiting to see how public opinion
and the politicians would receive this daring innovation.
"At length one evening a special dispatch steamer plowed her way
over the bar, and a perspiring messenger delivered into Gen. Hunter's
hands a special despatch from the War Department, 'requiring immedi¬
ate answer.' The General was just about mounting his horse for his
evening ride along the picket-line, when this portentous missive was
brought under his notice. Hastily opening it, he first looked grave,
then began to smile, and finally burst into peals of irrepressible laugh¬
ter, such as were rarely heard from 'Black David,' his old army name.
Never was the General seen, before or since, in such good spirits; he liter¬
ally was unable to speak from constant interruption of laughter; and
all his Adjutant-General could gather from him was: 'That he would not
part with the document in his hand for fifty thousand dollars.'
"At length he passed over the dispatch to his Chief of Staff, who on
reading it, and re-reading it, could find in its texts but little apparent
cause for merriment. It was a grave demand from the War Department
for information in regard to our negro regiment—the demand being
based on a certain resolution introduced by the Hon. Mr. Wickliffe, of
Kentucky, asking for specific information on the point, in a tone clearly
not friendly. These resolutions had been adopted by Congress; and as
Hunter was without authority for any of his actions in this case, it
seemed to his then not cheerful Adjutant-General that the documents in
his hands were the reverse of hilarious.
"Still Hunter was in extravagant spirits as he rode along, his
laughter startling the squirrels in the dense pine woods, and every at¬
tempt that he made to explain himself being again and again inter¬
rupted by renewed peals of inextinguishable mirth. 'The fools!' he at
length managed to say; 'that old fool has just given me the very chance
I was growing sick for I The War Department has refused to notice my
black regiment; but now, in reply to this resolution, I can lay the matter
before the country, and force the authorities either to adopt my negroes
or to disband them.' He then rapidly sketched 'out the kind of reply he
wished to have prepared; and, with the first ten words of his explana¬
tion, the full force of the cause he had for laughter became apparent.
Never did a General and his Chief-of-Staff, in a more unseemly state of
cachinnation, ride along a picket-line. At every new phase of the subject
it presented new features of the ludicrous; and though the reply at this
late date may have lost much of the drollery which then it wore, it is a
serio-comic document of as much vital importance in the moral history
of our late contest as any that can be found in the archives under the
care of Gen. E. D. Townsend. It was received late Sunday evening, and
was answered very late that night, in order to be in time for the steamer
