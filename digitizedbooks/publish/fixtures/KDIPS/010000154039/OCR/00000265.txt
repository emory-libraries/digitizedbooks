was the conflict over in the fort itself. The party "which had gained
access by the salient next the sea could not escape. It was certain death
to attempt to pass the line of concentrated fire which swept the faces of
the work, and they did not attempt it; but they would not surrender,
and in desperation kept up a constant fire upon the main body of the
fort. The Confederates called for volunteers to dislodge them—a sum¬
mons which was promptly responded to by Major McDonald, of the
Fifty-first North Carolina, and by Captain Rion, of the Charleston Bat¬
talion, with the requisite number of men. Rion's company was selected,
and the gallant Irishman, at the head of his company, dashed at the
reckless and insane men, who seemed to insist upon immolation. The
tables were nowsingularly turned; the assailants had become the assailed
and they held a fort within the fort, and were protected by the traverses
and gun chambers, behind which they fought. Rion rushed at them, but
he fell, shot outright, with several of his men, and the rest recoiled. At
this time General Hagood reported to General Taliaferro with Colonel
Harrison's splendid regiment, the Thirty-second Georgia, sent over by
Beauregard to his assistance as soon as a landing could be effected at
Cummings' Point. These troops were ordered to move along on the
traverses and bomb-proofs, and to plunge their concentrated fire over
the stronghold. Still, for a time, the enemy held out, but at last they
cried out and surrendered.
"The carnage was frightful. It is believed the Federals lost more
men on that eventful night than twice the entire strength of the Confed¬
erate garrison. The Confederates lost eight killed and twenty wounded
by the bombardment and about fifty killed and one hundred and fifty
wounded altogether from .the bombardment and assault. Among the
killed were those gallant officers, Lieutenant Colonel Simkins and Major
Ramsey and among the wounded Captains DePass and Twiggs, of the
staff, and Lieutenants Storey (Aide-de-Camp), Power and Watties. Ac¬
cording to the statement of Chaplain Dennison the assaulting columns
in two brigades, commanded by General Strong and Colonel Putnam
(the division under General Seymour), consisted of the Fifty-fourth
Massachusetts, Third and Seventh New Hampshire, Sixth Connecticut
and One Hundredth New York, with a reserve brigade commanded by
General Stephenson. One of the assaulting regiments was composed of ne¬
groes (the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts) and to it was assigned the honor
of leading the white columns to the charge. It was a dearly purchased
compliment. Their Colonel (Shaw) was killed upon the parapet and the
regiment almost annihilated, although the Confederates in the darkness
could not tell the color of their assailants. Both the brigade comman¬
ders were killed as well as Colonel Chatfield.
" The same account says: ' We lost 55 officers and 585 men, a total
of 640, one of the choicest martyr rolls of the war.' By 'lost,' 'killed'
is supposed to be meant, but still that number greatly falls short of the
number reported by the Confederates to have been buried on the 19th by
them and by their own friends under a flag of truce. These reports show
