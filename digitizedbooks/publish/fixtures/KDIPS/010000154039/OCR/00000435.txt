The Phalanx in Virginia.

"About daybreak on the 25th, the enemy attacked toward the left,
drove in our pickets—Capts. Weld and Thayer in command—but were
checked before reaching the main line. The regiment was placed in sup¬
port of Battery England (No. 5). Two men were wounded.
Some changes in. the division here took place—the Twenty-ninth
Connecticut was transferred to another brigade, and the Tenth U. S. C.
T. to ours, and Col. Duncan was placed in command.
"About noon (25th) packed up everything, crossed the Appomat¬
tox, and after a fatiguing march through the heat and dust, reached
the Petersburg front a little before sunset and halted for orders. Soon
after dark moved to the left in a heavy rain-squall, and lay down on a
hillside as reserve to the troops in the trenches. At 11 p. m. ordered to
report to Gen. Terry. Marched back a mile and reported. Another
mile's march in another direction brought the regiment, about 1 a. m.,
to its position, where it lay down in the woods, again as a reserve. A
rattling fire of musketry was kept up all night.
"On the 26th, a camp was selected and had been partially cleared
up, when orders were received for the regiment to go into the trenches.
Reported at brigade headquarters at sunset, and soon afterward,
through the mud and darkness, the men silently felt their way into the
trenches, which the rain had reduced to the condition of a quagmire. It
was a slow process, and 10 o'clock came before all were in their places.
"During the following day (27th,) the parapet was raised and paths
made through the muddier portions of the trenches. Soon after dark a
furious cannonade began which lasted for several hours, and afforded
to the spectators on both sides a brilliant pyrotechnic display.
"Just after daybreak on the 28th, the enemy opened a heavy mus¬
ketry fire which lasted until after sunrise. He did not leave his works,
however, and our men remained stationary. A man of Company B,
while watching for a shot through a section of stove-pipe, which he had
improvised into a port-hole, was struck and killed by a sharp-shooter's
bullet.
" Soon after midnight on the 28th-29th, the regiment moved out of
the trenches, and after daylight marched a quarter of a mile to the
right and rear and went into camp in a cornfield. The men were at once
put to work constructing bomb-proofs, as the position was within sight
and range of the enemy's line. This occupied the entire day.
"Brig.-Gen. Birney's arrangement of the brigade did not seem to
have given satisfaction to higher authority, and it was broken up, and
the old brigade—Seventh, Eighth, Ninth U. S. C. T., and Twenty-ninth
Connecticut—were again united, with Col. Shaw in command.
"From this time until the 24th of September, the Seventh and
Eighth alternated with the Ninth and Twenty-ninth for duty in the
trenches—two days in and two out; and on the 'off' days furnishing
details of officers and men for fatigue purposes, in constructing new
works and strengthening old ones. The main lines at this point were
scarcely over a hundred yards apart, while from the advanced posts a
