more like a hunt for wild game than a battle between civilized men."
In his description of the battle at Brice's Cross Koads,
he says:
" The entire Confederate force was brought into action at once. "We
kept no reserves; every movement was quickly planned and executed
with the greatest celerity. A potent factor which made the battle far
bloodier than it would have been, was it being reported, and with some

of Major L. F. Booth, consisting of the 13th Tennessee
Cavalry, Major Bradford, and the 6th Phalanx Battery of
heavy artillery, numbering 262 men, and six guns. At
sunrise on the 13th, General Forrest's forces advanced
and attacked the fort. The garrison maintained a steady
brisk fire, and kept the enemy at bay from an outer line of
intrenchments. About 9 a. m. Major Booth was killed,
and Major Bradford taking command, drew the troops
back into the Fort, situated on a, high, steep and partially
