Recruiting and Organizing in South Carolina. 157
to our Government for information as to whether Gen, Hunter, in organ¬
izing his regiment of emancipated slaves, had acted under the authority
of our War Department, or whether the villany was of his own concep¬
tion. If he had acted under orders, why then terrible measures of fierce
retaliation against the whole Yankee nation were to be adopted; but if,
per contra, the iniquity were of his own motion and without the sanc¬
tion of our Government, then the foreshadowed retribution should be
made to fall only on Hunter and his officers.
" To this demand, with its alternative of threats, President Lincoln
was in no mood to make any definitive reply. In fact no reply at all was
sent, for, as yet, the most far-seeing political augurs could not determine
whether the bird seen in the sky of the Southern Department would
prove an eagle or a buzzard. Public opinion was not formed upon the
subject, though rapidly forming. There were millions who agreed with
Hunter in believing that 'that the black man should be made to fight
for the freedom which could not but be the issue of our war;' and then
they were outraged at the prospect of allowing black men to be killed or
maimed in company with our nobler whites.
"Failing to obtain any reply therefor, from the authorities at "Wash¬
ington, the Richmond people determined to pour out all their vengeance
on the immediate perpetrators of this last Yankee atrocity; and forth¬
with there was issued from the rebel War Department a General Order
number 60, we believe, of the series of 1862—reciting that' as the gov¬
ernment of the U. S. had refused to answer whether it authorized the
raising of a black regiment by Gen. Hunter or not' said General, his
staff, and all officers under his command who had directly or indirectly
participated in the unclean thing, should hereafter be outlaws not
covered by the laws of war; but to be executed as felons for the crimes of
' inciting negro insurrections wherever caught.'
" This order reached the ears of the parties mainly interested just as
Gen. Hunter was called to Washington, ostensibly for consultation on
public business; but really on the motion of certain prominent specula¬
tors in marine transportation, with those 'big things,' in Port Royal
harbor,—and they were enormous—with which the General had seen fit
to interfere. These frauds, however, will form a very fruitful and pregnant
theme for some future chapters. At present our business is with the slow
but certain growth in the public mind of this idea of allowing some black
men to be killed in the late war, and not continuing to arrogate death
and mutilation by projectiles and bayonets as an exclusive privilege for
our own beloved white race.
"No sooner had Hunter been relieved from this special duty at Wash¬
ington, than he was ordered back to the South, our Government still
taking no notice of the order of outlawry against him issued by the
rebel Secretary of War. He and his officers were thus sent back to en¬
gage, with extremely insufficient forces, in an enterprise of no common
difficulty, and with an agreeable sentence of bus. per col., if captured,
hanging over their devoted heads 1
