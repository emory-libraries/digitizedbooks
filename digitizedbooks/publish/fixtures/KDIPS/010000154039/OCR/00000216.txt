History of the Black Phalanx.
ded. The works must be taken. General Nelson was
ordered by General Dwight to take the battery on the left.
The 1st and 3rd Regiments went forward at double quick
time, and they were soon within the line of the enemy &
fire. Louder than the thunder of Heaven was the artil¬
lery rending the air shaking the earth itself; cannons,,
mortars and musketry alike opened a fiery storm upon
the advancing regiments; an iron shower of grape and
round shot, shells and rockets, with a perfect tempest of
rifle bullets fell upon them. On they went and down,,
scores falling on right and left. "The flag, the flag!"*
shouted the black soldiers, as the standard-bearer's body
was scattered by a shell. Two file-closers struggled for its.
possession; a ball decided the struggle. They fell faster
and faster; shrieks, prayers and curses came up from the
fallen and ascended to Heaven. The ranks closed up while
the column turned obliquely toward the point of fire, seem¬
ing to forget they were but men. Then the cross-fire of
grape shot swept through their ranks, causing the glitter¬
ing bayonets to go down rapidly. " Steady men, steady,"
cried bold Cailloux, his sword uplifted, his face the color of
the sulphureotis smoke that enveloped him and his follow¬
ers, as they felt the deadly hail which came apparently
from all sides. Captain Cailloux* was killed with the col-
* Captain Andre Callioux fell, gallently leading his men (Co. E) in the attack. With
many others of the charging column, his body lay between the lines of the Confederates-
and Federals, but nearer the works of the former, whose sharp-shooters guarded it
night and day, and thus prevented his late comrades from removing it. Several at¬
tempts' were made to obtain the body, but each attempt was met with a terrific storm'
of lead. It was not until after the surrender that his remains were recovered, and then
taken to his native city, New Orleans. The writer of this volume, himself wounded, was
in the city at the time, and witnessed the ftaneral pageant of the dead hero, the like of
which was never before seen in that, npr, perhaps, in any other American city, in honor
of a dead negro. The negro captains of the 2nd Kegiment acted as pall-bearers, while-
a long processiou of civic societies followed in the rear of detatchments of the Pha¬
lanx. A correspondent who witnessed the scene thus describes it:
"* * * * The arrival of the body developed to the white population here that
rue colored people had powerful organizations in the form of civic societies; as the-
Friends of the Order, of which Capt. Callioux was a prominent member, received th#
body, and had the coffin containing it, draped with the American flag, exposed in state-
in the commodious hall. Around the coffin, flowers were strewn in the pjreatest profu¬
sion, and candles were kept continually burning;. All the rites of the Catholic Church
were strictly complied with. The guard paced silently to and fro, and altogether it pre¬
sented as solemn a scene as was ever witnessed.
"In due time, the band of the Forty-second Massachusetts Regiment made it*
appearance, and discoursed the customary solemn airs. The officiating priest, Father-
Le Maistre, of the Church of St. Rose of Lima, who has paid not the least attention to
the excommunication and denunciations issued against him by the archbishop of this.
