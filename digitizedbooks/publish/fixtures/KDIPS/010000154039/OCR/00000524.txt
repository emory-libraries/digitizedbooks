History of the Black Phalanx.
expressly given to it on that account. "We remained here until the for¬
mation of the 25th Army Corps, when on the 5th day of December,
1864 we removed to the left of Fort Harrison, forming a part of the
2nd Brigade, 1st Division of that Corps.
" Here we remained during the rest of the winter, picketing, drilling,
building forts, and making roads, and preparing for the spring cam¬
paign. One division had been sent to Fort Fisher, and but two were
with the Army of the James. At length, late in the month of March,
1865, one of the remaining divisions was sent to the left, while the divis¬
ion to which this regiment was attached, together with one division of
the 24th Army Corps, was left to guard the defences north of the James.
The campaign opened vigorously. The last week in March brought a
series of splendid victories to the Union armies, and we began to feel
that the 'end' so ardently desired was near at hand. This regiment
had been placed in Fort Harrison, the most important position on our
line. The fort was said to be mined, and it was feared that the rebels
would make an attack in force near that point. On Saturday and Sun¬
day, April 1st and 2ad, the fighting on the left had been terrific but
generally favorable to us. We were ordered to observe with great care
all movements of the enemy in our front.
"At sunset of April 2nd, we witnessed the last rebel dress parade in
Virginia from the magazine of Fort Harrison. Early on the morning
qf April 3rd, 1865, the picket fires of the enemy began to wane, and an
ominous silence to prevail within his lines. Very soon deserters began
to come within our lines who reported that the lines in our front were
being evacuated. In a little while we saw the barracks of Fort Darling
in flames, and tremendous explosions followed each other in rapid suc¬
cession. The earliest dawn revealed to us the deserted lines, with their
guns spiked and their tents standing. We were ordered to advance at
once, but cautiously. The troops jumped over the breast-works, and,
avoiding the torpedoes, filed through the rebel abbatis, and then began
the race for Richmond.
"No words can describe the enthusiasm of the troops as they found
themselves fairly within t^ie rebel lines, and tramping along the bloody
roads leading to the ' capitol of secessia.' The honor of first entering
that city was most earnestly contested; many regiments threw away
everything but their arms, while this regiment 'double-quicked' in
heavy marching orders. Two companies of this regiment—G and C—had
been sent forward as skirmishers reaching the city close on the heels of
our cavalry, and were, without the slightest doubt, the first companies
of infantry to enter the city. Through the heat and dust the troops
struggled on, and at last, as we came in full view of the city, the air was
rent with such cheers as only the brave men, who had fought so long
and so nobly for that city could give. Since that time our history
has been blessedly unfruitful in stirring events. We remained in Rich¬
mond for a few days, and were then ordered to Petersburg; from here
we went to Point Lookout, Md., where we remained until the 25th Corps
