SOLDIERS:—As a mark of esteem and respect for your patriotic
devotion to the cause of human freedom, I desire to dedicate to you this
record of the services of the negro soldiers, whom you led so often and
successfully in the struggle for liberty and union during the great war
of 1861-'65.
Your coming from the highest ranks of social life, undeterred by the
prevailing spirit of caste prejudice, to take commands in the largest

victory.
The record of the Black Phalanx, invites the scrutiny of all who
have been disposed to taunt you for associating with " armed barbar¬
ians." No massacre of vanquished foe stains the banners of those who
followed you, giving quarter but receiving none. It was your teaching
that served as a complete restraint against retaliation, though states¬
men hinted that it would be just. Your training developed patriotism
and courage, but not revenge. Ungrateful as Republics are said to be,
ours has aimed to recognize merit and reward it, and those who at first
hailed you with contumely, are now glad to greet you as heroes and
saviors of a common country.
No true soldier desires to forget the price of his country's liberty, or
that of his own; it is the recollection of the terrible bloody onset—the au-
