Histoky of the Black Phalanx.
mer staff in hand, mortally wounded. His grave now marks the spot
where he fell. Several members of the artillery were wounded and a great
many battery horses were killed. The reason for this desperate stand
was soon discovered. The road was filled with their wagons, ambu¬
lances and many caissons, the dying and wounded. Cast-away arms,
accoutrements, baggage, dead animals and other evidences of a routed
army were conspicuous on every side. The sun had set, but the weary
and over-spent Confederates maintained the pursuit for some five or six
miles beyond and until it became quite too dark to go further. A tempor¬
ary halt was ordered, when a section from each battery was directed to be
•equipped with ammunition and the best horses from their respective bat¬
teries and be ready to continue the pursuit at daylight."
The rout was all the enemy could desire, the Federals
fought with a valor creditable to any troops, but were
badly worsted, through the incompetency of Sturgis.
They were driven back to Ripley, in a most disastrously
confused state, leaving behind their trains, artillery, dead
and wounded. But for the gallantry of the Phalanx, the
enemy would have captured the entire force.
The same writer describes the rout:
"Johnson, pressing his brigade forward upon the enemy's position
at Brice's Quarter, with Lyon supporting the artillery in the road below
Brice's house, the position was soon captured with many prisoners and
three pieces of artillery. Hallers and Mayson's sections were moved up
at a gallop and established on the hill at Brice's Quarter and opened a
destructive fire with double-shotted cannister upon the enemy's fleeing
columns and wagon trains. The bridge over Tishamingo creek, still
standing, was blocked up with wagons, some of whose teams had been
killed. Finding the bridge thus obstructed the enemy rushed wildly into
the creek, and as they emerged from the water on the opposite bank in
an open field, our artillery played upon them for half a mile, killing and
disabling large numbers. Forrests escort, under the dashing Lieutenant
Cowan, having become detached in the meantime, had pressed around to
the west side of the creek and south of the Ripley road, and here made
one of its characteristic charges across an open field near the gin house,
upon the enemy's wagon train, capturing several wagons.
Meanwhile Barteau was not idle. He had moved his regiment, as
-we have stated, across to get in the enemy's rear, and in his own lan¬
guage says: 'I took my regiment across the country westward, to
reach the Ripley road, on which the enemy was moving, and being de¬
layed somewhat in passing through a swampy bottom, I did not reach
that road, at Lyon's gin, three miles from Brice's Cross Roads, until
probably 1 o'clock. I then learned that the last of the Federal regiments,
with all their train, had passed by rapid march, and as there was now a
