ferred $7,890. In December the Saxton Bank at Beaufort
transferred $170,000. Thus the sum of $177,890, belong¬
ing to soldiers in two departments only, was placed to
their credit, subject to their order, in the new national
bank, called into existence by like motives. This bank
had branches at these places. Had similar banks been
established in the other departments an enormous sum
would have been collected. The Freedmen's bank, how¬
ever, took the place of these military banks, and had the
confidence of the soldiers who continued to deposit in its
various branches throughout the south. When that insti¬
tution collapsed in 1874, of the many millions of dollars
deposited in it, it is estimated that two-thirds of the
amount was the savings of the Phalanx. There is now in
the vaults of the national government more than a quar¬
ter of a million of dollars belonging to the Phalanx, held
as unclaimed bounty and pay—an ample sum from which
to erect a suitable monument to commemorate the heroic
devotion and patriotic endeavor of those who fell in Free¬
dom's cause. This money doubtless belongs to those who
on the battle-fields and in hospitals died for the country's
honor. These are some of the lessons taught by the
history of the Black Phalanx.
