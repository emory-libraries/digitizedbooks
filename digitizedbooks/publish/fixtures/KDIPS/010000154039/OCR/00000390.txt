History of the Black Phalanx.
But for having been misinformed as to Lee's retreat¬
ing on Richmond,—which led him to draw his forces back
into his intrenchments,—Butler would have undoubtedly
marched triumphantly into Petersburg. The mistake
gave the enemy holding the approaches to that city time
to be re-enforced, and Petersburg soon became well forti¬
fied and garrisoned. Beaureguard succeeded in a few
days time in concentrating in front of Butler 25,000
troops, thus checking the latter's advance toward Rich¬
mond and Petersburg, on the south side of the James,
though skirmishing went on at various points.
General Grant intended to have Butler advance and
capture Petersburg, while General Meade, with the Army
of the Potomac, advanced upon Richmond from the

Phalanx ready and on the alert.
After the battle of Drewry's Bluff, May 16th, Butler
thought to remain quiet in his intrenchments, but Grant,
on the 22nd, ordered him to send all his troops, save
enough to hold City Point, to join the Army of the Po¬
tomac; whereupon General W. F. Smith, with 16,000 men,
embarked for the White House, on the Pamunky river,
Butler retaining the Phalanx division and the Cavalry.
Thus ended the operations of the Army of the James,
until Grant crossed the river with the army of the Po¬
tomac.
On the 13th of May, Grant determined upon a flank
movement toward Bowling Green, with a view of making
