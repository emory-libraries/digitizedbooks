mention one. A negro soldier had got a stump quite close to the Con¬
federate line, and despite all efforts to dislodge him, there he stuck, pick¬
ing off their men. The Confederates charged the stump, but the Federal
line observing it concentrated their fire on the advancing men and drove
them back. Then there were long and loud cheers for the brave darkey,
who stuck to his stump and fired away with a regularity that was won¬
derful. His stump was riddled with bullets, but he stuck to it, although
he was at times nearer the Confederate lines than our own." *
