488 History of the Black Phalanx.
of the Union troops. The negro had become a soldier
in the Unioti army, and was helping to crush the rebel¬
lion. President Lincoln had declared all slaves in rebel-
dom free, and thousands of black soldiers were march¬
ing and carrying the news to the slaves.
This state of affairs lead President Davis and his cab¬
inet to resign to the inevitable, as had the North, and to
inaugurate the policy of emancipating and arming the
slaves, knowing full well that it was sheer folly to expect
to recruit their shattered armies from the negro popula¬
tion without giving them their freedom.
It was therefore in the last days of the confederate
authorities, and it was their last hope and effort for suc¬
cess-. Despair had seized upon them. The army was daily
thinned more by desertion than by the bullets of the
Union soldiers, while Sherman's march from Atlanta to
the sea had awakened the widest alarm. In the winter of
1864 and 1865 the question of arming the slaves was
presented as a means of recruiting the depleted and disor¬
dered ranks of the army, and it soon assumed an impor¬
tance that made it an absorbing topic throughout the
Confederacy. There was no other source to recruit from.
The appeal to foreigners was fruitless. "The blacks had
been useful soldiers for the northern army, why should
they not be made to fight for their masters?" it was asked.
Of course there was the immediate query whether they
would fight to keep themselves in slavery. This opened
up a subject into which those who discussed it were afraid
to look; nevertheless it seemed unavoidable that a black
conscription should be attempted, and with that in view,
every precaution was taken by those who supported the
scheme to avoid heightening the dissensions already too
prevalent for good. The newspapers were advised of the
intended change of policy, to which not a few of them
acquiesced. General Lee was consulted, as the following
letter, afterward printed in the Philadelphia Times, shows:
