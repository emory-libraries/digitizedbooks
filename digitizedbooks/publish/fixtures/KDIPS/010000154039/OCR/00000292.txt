290 History of the Black Phalanx.
negro troops in battle, may, perhaps, be pardoned for feeling a good de¬
gree of pride in our share of the thrilling events of the great war.
" When Sumter was fired upon, April, 1861, I was 21; a member of
the Senior Class in Franklin College, Indiana. I enlisted in the 7th Indi-
anaVolunteer infantry and served as a private soldier for three months in
"West Virgiuia, under Gen. McClellan,—' the young Napoleon,' as he was
even then known. I participated in the battle of Carricks Ford, where
Gen. Garnett was killed and his army defeated. In August 1862,1 re-en¬
listed as a First Lieutenant in the 70th Indiana, (Col. Benjamin Harrison)
and saw service in Kentucky and Tennessee.
"In January 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued the Proclamation of
Emancipation, and incorporated in it the policy of arming the negro for
special service in the Union army. Thus the question was fairly up, and
I entered into its discussion with the deepest interest, as I saw that upon
its settlement hung great issues.
" On the one hand the opponents of the policy maintained that to
make soldiers of the negroes would be to put them on the same level with
white soldiers, and so be an insult to every man who wore the blue. It
was contended, too, that the negro was not fit for a soldier because he
belonged to a degraded, inferior race, wanting in soldierly qualities; that
his long bondage had crushed out whatever of manliness he might nat-
uarally possess; that he was too grossly ignorant to perform, intelligent¬
ly, the duties of the soldier; that his provocation had been so great as a
slave, that when once armed, and conscious of his power as a soldier, he
would abuse it by acts of revenge and wanton cruelty.
"It was urged, on the other hand, that ill its fearful struggle for ex¬
istence, the Republic needed the help of the able-bodied negroes; that
with their natural instincts of self-preservation, desire for liberty, habit
of obedience, power of imitation, love of pomp and parade, acquaint¬
ance with the southern country and adaptation to its climate, they had
elements which peculiarly fitted them for soldiers. It was further urged
that the negro had more at stake than the white man, and that he
should have a chance to strike a blow for himself. It was particularly
insisted upon that he needed just the opportunity which army service
afforded to develop and exhibit whatever of manliness he possessed. As
the war progressed, and each great battle-field was piled with heaps of
the killed and wounded of our best citizens, men looked at each other
seriously, and asked if a black man would not stop a bullet as well as a
white man? Miles O'Beilly at length voiced a popular sentiment when
he said,
"' The right to be killed I'll divide with the nayger,
And give him the largest half.'
"With the strong conviction that 1?he negro was a man worthy of
freedom, and possessed of all the essential qualities of a good soldier, I
early advocated the organization of colored regiments,—not for fatigue
or garrison duty, but for field service.
" In October, 1863, having applied for a position as an officer in the
