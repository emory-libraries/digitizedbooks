"The efficiency and health of a battalion depends so much upon its
officers, that, in order to institute a fair comparison, when so small a
number of troops are considered, this element should be eliminated.
This has not, however, been attempted in this paper."
[Reply in Full No. 1.]
" Morris Island, S. C., Sept. 11th, 1863.
"Major:—In answer to your several queries as per circular of Septem¬
ber 10, 18G3, requesting my opinion as to the relative merits of white
and black trodps, for work in the trenches, I have the honor to make the
the following replies:
" I. ' Their courage as indicated by their behavior under fire.' I will
eay, in my opinion, their courage is rather of the passive than the active
kind. They will stay, endure, resist, and follow, but they have not the
restless, aggressive spirit. I do not believe they will desert their officers
in trying moments, in so great numbers as the whites; they have not the
will, audacity or fertility of excuse of the straggling white, and at the
same time they have not the heroic, nervous energy, or vivid perception
of the white, who stands firm or presses forward.
"I do not remember a single instance, in my labors in the trenches,
where the black man has skulked away from his duty, and I know that
instances of that kind have occurred among the whites; still I think
that the superior energy and intelligence of those remaining, considering
that the whites were the lesser number by the greater desertion, would
more than compensate.
" II. ' Skill and appreciation of their duties referring to the quality
of the work.'
" They have a fair share of both; enough to make them very useful
and efficient, but they have not apparently that superior intelligence
and skill that may be found largely among the non-commissioned offi¬
cers and privates of the white regiments.
"III. 'Industry and perseverence with reference to the quantity of
the work done.'
"I think they will do more than the whites; they do not have so
many complaints and excuses, but stick to their work patiently, dogged¬
ly, obediently, and accomplish a great deal, though I have never known
them to work with any marked spirit or energy. I should liken the
white man to the horse (often untractable and balky), the black man to
the ox.
" IV. 'If a certain work were to be accomplished in the least possi¬
ble time, i. e., when enthusiasm and direct personal interest is necessary
to attain the end, would whites or blacks answer best?'
" I cannot make up my mind that it is impossible to arouse the
enthusiasm of the blacks, for I have seen enough of them to know that
they are very emotional creatures; still though they might have more
dash than I have seen and think possible, it is unquestionable to my
mind that were the enthusiasm and personal interest of both aroused,
the white would far surpass the black.
