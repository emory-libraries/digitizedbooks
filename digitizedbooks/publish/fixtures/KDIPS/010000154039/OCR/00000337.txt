The Black Flag
335
Question. Did you see any rebel officers about while this shooting
was going on? 'Answer. I do not know as I saw any officers about
when they were shooting the negroes. A captain came to me a few min¬
utes atfter I was shot; he was close by me when I was shot.
'Question. Did he try to stop the shooting? 'Answer. I did not
hear a word of their trying to stop it. After they were shot down, he
told them not to shoot them any more. I begged him not to let them
shoot me again, and he said they would not. One man, after he was shot
down, was shot again. After I was shot down, the man I surrendered to
went around the tree I was against and shot a man, and then came
around to me again and wanted my pocket-book. I handed it up to
him, and he saw my watch-chain and made a grasp at it, and got the
watch and about half the chain. He took an old Barlow knife I had in
my pocket. It wa? not worth five cents; was of no account at all, only to
cut tobacco with."
"Nathan G. Fulks, sworn and examined. By Mr. Gooch:
'Question. To what company and regiment do you belong? 'An¬
swer. To Company D, 13th Tennessee cavalry.
"Question. Where are you from? 'Answer. About twenty miles
from Columbus, Tennessee.
' Question. How long have you been in the service? 'Answer. Five

'Question. Were you at Fort Pillow at the time of the fight there?
Answer.. Yes, sir.
'Question. Will you state what happened to you there? 'Answer. I
was at the corner of the fort when they fetched in a flag for a surrender.
Some of them said the major stood a while, and then said he would not
surrender. They continued to fight a while; and after a time the major
started and told us to take care of ourselves, and I and twenty more
men broke for the hollow. They ordered us to halt, and some of them
said, 'God d—n 'em, kill 'em!' I said, 'I have surrendered.' I had
thrown my gun away then. I took off my cartridge-box and gave it to
one of them, and said, 'Don't shoot me;' but they did shoot me, and hit
just about where the shoe comes up on my leg. I begged them not to
shoot me, and he said, ' God d—n you, you fight with the niggers, and
we will kill the last one of you!' Then they shot me in the thick of the
thigh, and I fell; and one set out to shoot me again, when another one*
said, 'Don't shoot the white fellows any more.?
'Question. Did you see any person shot besides yourself? 'Answer.
I didn't see them shot. I saw one of our fellows dead by me.
'Question. Did you see any buildings burned? 'Answer. Yes, sir.
While I was in the major's headquarters they commenced burning the
buildings, and I begged one of them to take me out and not let us burn
there; and he said, 'I am hunting up a piece of yellow flag for yoij.' I
think we would have whipped them if the flag of truce had not come in.
