History of the Black Phalanx.
jeen reserved for the New World to present the spectacle of civil war,
jailing servile war to its aid, and of inen of English race and language
30 envenomed against each other that one party places arms in the
lands of the half savage negro, and the other acts as if resolved to give
no quarter to the insurgent race or the white man who commands them
Dr fights by their side. In the valley of the Mississippi, where these ne-
^ro soldiers are in actual service, it seems likely that a story as revolt¬
ing as that of St. Domingo is being prepared for the world. No one who
reads the description of the fighting at Port Hudson, and the accounts
given by the papers of scenes at other places, can help fearing that the
worst part of this war has yet to come, and that a people who lately
boasted that they took the lead in education and material civilization
are now carrying on a contest without regard to any law of conven¬
tional warfare,—one side training negroes to fight against its own white
flesh and blood, the other slaughtering them without mercy whenever
they find them in the field.
" * * * It is pitiable to find these unhappy Africans, whose clumsy
frames are no match for the sinewy and agile white American, thus led
on to be destroyed by a merciless enemy. Should the war proceed in
this manner, it is possible that the massacre of Africans may not be
confined to actual conflict in the field. Hitherto the whites have been
sufficiently confident in the negroes to leave them unmolested, even
when the enemy was near; but with two or three black regiments in
each federal corps, and such events as the Port Hudson massacre occur-
ing to infuriate the minds on either side, who can foresee what three
months more of war may bring forth?
"All that we can say with certainty is that the unhappy negro will
be the chief sufferer in this unequal conflict. An even greater calamity,
however, is the brutalization of two antagonistic peoples by the intro¬
duction into the war of these servile allies of the federals. Already
there are military murders and executions on both sides. The horrors
which Europe has foreseen for a year past are no\y upon us. Reprisal
will provoke reprisal, until all men's natures are hardened, and the land
flows with blood."
The article is truly instructive to the present genera¬
tion ; its malignity and misrepresentation of the Admin¬
istration's intentions in regard to the arming of negroes,
serves to illustrate the deep-sea,ted animosity which then
existed in England toward the union of the States. Nor
will the American negro ever forget England's advice to
the confederates, whose massacre of negro soldiers fight¬
ing for freedom she endorsed and applauded. The descen¬
dants of those black soldiers, who were engaged in the
prolonged struggle for freedom, can rejoice in the fact
