"Apropos of the prejudice against so called nigger officers, I may
mention the following incident: While an officer in the 70th Indiana, I
had met, and formed a passing acquaintance with Lieut.-Colonel , of
the — Ohio Regiment. On New Years Day, 1864,1 chanced to meet him
at a social gathering at General Ward's headquarters in Nashville. I
spoke to him as usual, at the same time offering my hand, which appar¬
ently he did not see. Receiving only a cool bow from him, I at once
turned away. As I did so he remarked to those standing near him that
he ' did not recognize these nigger officers.' In some way, I do not know
how, a report of the occurrence came to the ears of Lorenzo Thomas,,
the Adjutant-General of the Army, then in Nashville, who investigated
the case, and promptly dismissed Colonel from the United States.
service.
"Very few West Point officers had any faith in the success of the en¬
terprise, and most Northern people perhaps, regarded it as at best a
dubious experiment. A college classmate of mine, a young man of intel¬
ligence and earnestly loyal, although a Kentuckian, and a slave-holder,,
plead with me to abandon my plan of entering this service, saying, 'I
shudder to think of the remorse you may suffer, from deeds done by
barbarians under your command.'
"General George H. Thomas, though a Southerner, and a West
Point graduate, was a singularly fair-minded, candid man. He asked
me one day soon after my regiment was organized, if I thought my men.
would fight. I replied that they would. He said he thought)' they might
behind breastworks.' I said they would fight in the open field. He-
thought not. ' Give me a chance General,' I replied,' and I will prove it.'
"Our evening parades converted thousands to a belief in colored
troops. It was almost a daily experience to hear the remark from visi¬
tors, ' Men who can handle their arms as these do, will fight.' General
Thomas paid the regiment the compliment of saying that he 'never saw
a regiment go through the manual as well as this one.' We remained in
'Camp Whipple'from February, 1864, till August, 1865, a period of
eighteen months, and during a large part of that time the regiment was
an object lesson to the army, and helped to revolutionize public opinion
on the subject of colored soldiers.
"My Lieutenant-Colonel and I rode over one evening to call on Gen¬
eral Joe Hooker, commanding the 20th Army Corps. He occupied a
small log hut in the Wauhatchie Yalley, near Lookout Mountain and
not far from the Tennessee river. He received us with great courtesy,
and when he learned that we were officers in a colored regiment, congrat¬
ulated us on our good fortune, saying that he 'believed they would
make the best troops in the world.' He predicted that after the rebellion
was subdued, it would be necessary for the United States to send aa
army into Mexico. This army would be composed largely of colored
men, and those of us now holding high command, would have a chance
to win great renown. He lamented that he had made a great mistake in
not accepting a military command, and going to Nicaragua with Gen-
