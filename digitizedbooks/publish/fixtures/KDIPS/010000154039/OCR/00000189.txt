ings of relationship with the families from which they came, and with a sense of unmeri¬
ted banishment as culprits, all which tends to bring upon them a greater severity of
treatment and a corresponding disinclination 'to receive punishment'. They are far
superior beings to their ancestors, who were brought from Africa two generations ago,
and who occasionally rebelled against comparatively less severe punishment than is in¬
flicted now. While rising in the scale of Christian beings, their treatment is being ren¬
dered more severe than ever. The whip, the chains, the stocks, and imprisonment are
no mere fancies here; they are used to any extent to which the imagination of civilized
man may reach. Many of them are as intelligent as their masters, and far more moral,
for while the slave appeals to the moral law as his vindication, clinging to it as to the
very horns of the alter of his safety and his hope, the master seldom hesitates to wrest
him from it with violence and contempt. The slave, it is true, bears no resentment; he
asks for no punishment for his master; he simply claims justice for himself; and it is
this feature of his condition that promises more terror to the retribution when it
comes. Even now the whites stand accursed by their oppression of humanity, being
subject to a degree of confusion, chaos, and enslavement to error and wrong, which
northern society could not credit or comprehend.
"Added to the four millions of the colored race whose disaffection is increasing
even more rapidly than their number, there are at least four millions more of the white
race whose growing miseries will naturally seek companionship with those of the blacks.
This latter portion of southern society has its representatives, who swing from the
scaffold with the same desperate coolness, though from a directly different cause, as
that which was manifested by John Brown. The trator Mumford, who swung the
other day for trampling on the national flag, had been rendered placid and indifferent
in his desperation by a government that either could not or would not secure to its
subjects the blessings of liberty which that flag imports. The South cries for justice
from the government as well as the North, though in a proud and resentful spirit; and
in what manner is that justice to be obtained? Is it to be secured by that wretched re¬
source of a set of profligate politicians, called 'reconstruction?' No, it is to be ob¬
tained by the abolition of slavery, and by no other course.
"It is vain to deny that the slave system of labor is giving shape to the govern¬
ment of the society where it exists, and that that government is not republican, either
in form or spirit. It was through this system that the leading conspirators have
sought to fasten qpon the people an aristocracy or a despotism; and it is not suffi¬
cient that they should be merely defeated in their object, and the country be rid of their
rebellion; for by our constitution we are imperatively obliged to sustain the State
against the ambition of uprincipled leaders, and secure to them the republican form of
government. AVe have positive duties to perform, and should hence adopt and pursue
a positive, decided policy. We have services to render to certain states which they can¬
not perform for themselves. We are in an emergency which the framers of the constitu¬
tion might easily have foreseen, and for which they have amply provided.
"It is clear that the public good requires slavery to be abolished; but in what man¬
ner is it to be done? The mere quiet operation of congressional law can not deal with
slavery as. in its former status before the war, because the spirit of law is right rea¬
son, and there is no reason in slavery. A system so unreasonable as slavery can not
be regulated by reason. We can hardly expect the several states to adopt laws or
measures against their own immediate interests. We have seen that they will rather
find arguments for crime than seek measures for abolishing or modifying slavery. But
there is one principle which is fully recognized as a necessity in conditions like ours, and
that is that the public safety is the supreme law of the State, and that amid the clash
of arms the laws of peace are silent. It is then for our president, the commander-in-
chief of our armies, to declare the abolition of slavery, leaving it to the wisdom of
congress to adopt measures to meet the consequences. This is the usual course pur¬
sued by a general or by a military power. That power gives orders affecting complica¬
ted interests and millions of property, leaving it to the other functions of government
to adjust and regulate the effects produced. Let the president abolish slavery, and it
would be an easy matter for congress, through a well-regulated system of apprentice¬
ship, to adopt safe measures for effecting a gradual transition from slavery to freedom.
"The existing system of labor in Louisiana is unsuited to the age; and by the in¬
trusion of the national forces it seems falling to pieces. It is a system of mutual jeal¬
ousy and suspicion between the master and the man—a system of violence, immorality
and vice. The fugitive negro tells us that our presence renders his condition worse
with his master than it was before, and that we offer no alleviation in return. The sys¬
tem is impolitic, because it offers but one stimulent to labor and effort, viz.: the lash,
when another, viz.: money, might be added with good effect. Fear, and the other low
and bad qualities of the slave, are appealed to, but never the good. The relation,
therefore, between capital and labor, which ought to be generous and confiding,is dark¬
ling, suspicious, unkindly, full of reproachful threats, and without concord or peace.
This condition of things renders the interests of society a prey to politicians. Politics
cease to be practical or useful.
"The questions that ought to have been discussed in the late extraordinary con¬
vention of Louisiana, are: First, What ought the State of Louisiana to do to adopt
her ancient system of labor to the present advanced spirit of the age ? And Second,
How can the State be assisted by the general government in effecting the change? But
instead of this, the only question before that body was how to vindicate slavery by
flogging the Yankees!
''Compromises hereafter are not to be made with politicians, but with sturdy labor
and the right to work. The interests of workingmen resent political trifling. Our po¬
litical education, shaped almost entirely to the interest of slavery, has been false and
vicious in the extreme, nnd it must be corrected with as much suddenness, almost, as
that with which Salem witchcraft came to an end. The only question that remains to
decide is how the change shall take place.
" We are not without examples and precedents in the history of the past. The en¬
franchisement of the Ipeople of Europe has been, and is still going on, through the in¬
strumentality of military service; and by this means our slaves might be raised in the
