398 History of the Black Phalanx.
with this, and as soon as General Smith, who, with a por¬
tion of Butler's forces had been temporarily dispatched
to join the army of the Potomac at Cold Harbor, re¬
turned to Bermuda Hundreds with his force, he was or¬
dered forward to capture the Cockade City. It was mid¬
night on the 14th, when Smith's troops arrived. Butler
ordered him immediately forward against Petersburg,
and he moved accordingly. His force was in three divis¬
ions of Infantry, and one of Cavalry, under General
Kautz, who was to threaten the line of works on the Nor¬
folk road. General Hinks, with his division of the Pha¬
lanx, was to take position across the Jordon's Point road
on the right of Kautz; Brooks' division of white troops
was to follow, Hinks coming in at the center of the line,
while General Martindale with the other division was to
move along the Appomattox and strike the City Point
road. Smith's movement was directed against the north¬
east side of Petersburg, extending from the City Point
to the Norfolk railroad. About daylight On the 15th, as
the columns advanced on the City Point road at Bailey's
farm, six miles from Petersburg, a confederate battery
opened fire. Kautz reconnoitered and found a line of rifle
trench, extending along the front, on rapidly rising ground,
with a thicket covering. The work was held by a regiment
of cavalry and a light battery. At once there was use for
the Phalanx; the works must be captured with the bat¬
tery before the troops could proceed. The cavalry was
re-called, and Hinks began the formation of an attacking
party from his division. The confederates were in an open
field, their battery upon a knoll in the same field, com¬
manding a sweeping position to its approaches. The
advancing troops must come out from the woods, rush
up the slope and carry it at the point of the bayonet, ex¬
posed to the tempest of musketry and cannister of the
battery. Hinks formed his line for the assault, and the
word of command was given,—"forward." The line
emerged from the woods, the enemy opened with cannis¬
ter upon the steadily advancing column, which, without
stopping, replied with a volley of Minie bullets.
" The long, dusky line, arm to arm, knee to knee."
