History of the Black Phalanx.
The loss in officers right here was very heavy; sixteen were killed and
sixty-one wounded. Captain Ab Hust, a mere boy, who commanded
Bell's escort, rendered most efficient service at this critical juncture, and
Major 'Tom Allison, the fighting Quartermaster of Bell's Brigade, was
constantly by the side of his fearless commander, and in this terrible
loss in staff officers his presence was most opportune.
" Like a prairie on fire the battle raged and the volleying thunder can
be likened in my mind to nothing else than the fire of Cleburne's Divi¬
sion at Chickamauga, on that terrible Saturday at dusk. At length the
enemy's lines wavered, Ilaller and Mayson pressed their guns by hand
to within a short distance of Brice's house, firing as they advanced.
Bell, Lyon and Rucker now closed in on the cross roads and the Federals
gave way in disorder, abandoning three guns near Brice's house. General
Sturgis, in his official report of the fight, says: 'We had four pieces of
artillery at the cross roads. * * * Finding our troops were being
hotly pressed, I ordered one section to open on the enemy's reserves.
The enemy's artillery soon replied, and with great accuracy, every shell
bursting over and in the immediate vicinity of our guns.' A shell from
one of the Confederate guns struck the table in Brice's porch, was used
by General Sturgis, stunning that officer."
The terrible struggle which now ensued was not sur¬
passed, according to an eye-witness, by the fighting of any
troops. The Phalanx were determined, if courage could
do it, to whip the men who had so dastardly massacred
the garrison of Fort Pillow. This fact was known to For¬
rest, Buford and their troops, who fought like men real¬
izing that anything short of victory was death, and well
may they have thus thought, for every charge the Phalanx
made meant annihilation. They, too, accepted the por¬
tentous fiat, victory or death.
Though more than twenty years have passed since
this bloody fight, yet the chief of the confederate artillery
portrays the situation in these words:
"Is was soon evident that another strong-line had formed behind the
fence by the skirt of woods just westward of Phillips' branch. General
Forrest riding up, dismounted and approached our guns, which were
now plying shell and solid shot. With his field glasses he took in the
situation. The enemy's shot were coming thick and fast; leaden balls
were seen to flatten as they would strike the axles and tires of our gun
carriages; trees were barked and the air was ladened with the familiar
but unpleasant sound of these death messengers.
Realizing General Forrest's exposure, we involuntarily ventured the
suggestion that, 'You had better get lower down the hill, General.' In-
