LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF HOSEA.
the revolt at Shechem Israel was guilty of
one political blunder after another. Dur¬
ing the 250 years of the kingdom's exist¬
ence, not a single good king wielded the
royal scepter. It was conspicuous for its
idolatry and entangling alliances. In the
national life of Israel there are four periods
that stand out clear and plain, each of which
is marked by the strong personality of the
most prominent king of that period. In the
first period the most conspicuous king was
Jeroboam, the revolter; in the second,
Ahab, the wicked king; in the third, Jehu,
somewhat of a reformer, and in the fourth,
Pekah, the royal assassin. During the first
period, idolatry took root, Bethel and Dan
came into prominence; during the second,
it was in full bloom under the furious and
fanatical leading of Jezebel, wife of the
king; during the third, it was held some¬
what in abeyance through the influence of
the prophets. The rugged Elijah flourish¬
ed here. During the fourth period, idola¬
try produced its natural fruit, the utter dis¬
solution and destruction of the kingdom. It
is the political side of this last period that
now passes before us for a brief review.
