LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF HOSEA.
King of Syria, and carried captive to As¬
syria the inhabitants of Gilead, Galilee and
Naphtali. Nearly twenty years later, Shal-
maneser besieged Samaria and carried off
the remnant of Israel. "Truth is fallen in
the street, and equity cannot enter."
"Mercy and truth are
Glorious tt*ether' ,
. . . Righteousness and peace
Anticipation. have kissed eadl
other.
Truth shall spring out of the earth ;
And righteousness shall look down from
heaven."
—Ps. 85 :10-11.
The remaining verses of the chapter ex¬
cept the last one are filled with glorious an¬
ticipations and glowing hopes of what the
captivity will do for the nation. His pun¬
ishment had been a work of love, inflicted
with a desire to correct and reform the
•erring spouse. In the mind of the opti¬
mistic and indulgent Father punishment
has done its perfect work, and now, "They
shall walk after the Lord. He shall roar,
(call),like a lion; when He shall roar then
the children shall tremble from the west."
Tremble because of their precipitate agita¬
tion and haste to return to God and their
native land.
