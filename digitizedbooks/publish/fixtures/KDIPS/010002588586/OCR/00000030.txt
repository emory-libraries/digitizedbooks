LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF HOSEA.
"withdraw himself from them." He would
"return unto His place," retire into His un¬
approachable heavens to make them feel
the need of Him. But these light, silly,
flippant optimistic children do not take it
seriously. They trifle with the Deity. En¬
trenched in egotism and pride and the
memory of so many favors, they reason that
God has only torn them that He may heal
them, and has thrown the mdown that He
may take them up again in a day or two,
"As soon as we seek him we shall find
Him." "It is a very small matter, any
way."
"Come and let us return to Jehovah:
For He hath rent, that he may heal us,
And hath wounded, that he may bind us
up.
He will bring us to life in a couple of
days;
On the third day tie will raise us up agafoi,
That we may live in His presence.
Let us know, let us follow up to know
Jehovah:
As soon as we seek Him we shall find Him.
And He shall come to us like ihe winter-
rain,
Like the spring-rain pouring on the land!"
