life And prophecies of hosea.
To know another perfectly, and in the
highest sense is to hate or love the person
known. It was no mere ignorance of facts
that beclouded Israel's mind and seared the
nation's conscience. They were well ac¬
quainted with their past providential his¬
tory, the events of which were kept green
in their memory.
These they had Crowned, immortalized
at Bethel ahd Gilgal, at Dan and Beershe-
ba.; But Israel was ignorant of the char¬
acter and purpose of God which s'hoile
through these facts with, an ever increasing
lustre. The bitterest weeping of the proph¬
et was over this fact—ignorance of . the
real character of God. No mere memory of
the past could bring this knowledge to them.
The prophet had tried it and failed. Hence
Jehovah must desert His faithless spouse
and let her feel the harlot's shame and bit¬
ter memories of the better past. When
this is done He will return and lead her up
out of tfie wilderness and "they shall re¬
vive as the corn and grow as the vine" and
"Ephraim shall say;, What have I to do any
more with idols?"
"Who is wise, and he shall understand
these things, prudent and he shall know
them? for the ways of the Lord are right,
and the just shall walk in them; but the
transgressors shall fall therein "
