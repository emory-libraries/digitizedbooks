LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF HOSEA.
profligates. Zachariah, his son, was openly
assassinated after a reign of six months.
Shallum, his murderer, reigned one month
and was murdered by Menahem, who
reigned ten years in Samaria. Pekohiah
succeeded him, lasted two years, was
stabbed by Pekoh, one of his captains, who
reigned twenty years. He was at last mur¬
dered by Hoshea. Then tumult and an¬
archy let loose, and for ten years there was
a reign of terror. He reigned nine years,
after which the very nation of whom Is¬
rael had sought help came up against Sa¬
maria and carried the ten tribes away. Of
all of this the prophet here warns Israel.
"Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reap¬
ed iniquity, ye have eaten the fruit of lies,
therefore shall a tumult arise among thy
people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled.
* * * * shall Bethel do unto you be¬
cause of your great wickedness', in a morn¬
ing shall the king of Israel utterly be cut
off."
