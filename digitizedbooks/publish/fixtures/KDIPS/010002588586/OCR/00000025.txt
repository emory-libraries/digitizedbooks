LIFE AND PROPHECIES OP HOSEA.
III.
Darkness and Gloom, With Here and
There a Ray of Light.
Chapters 4 and 14 cannot be clearly di¬
vided into sections. The mists and shadows
of Israel's threatened doom pass before the
prophet's bewildered vision in panoramic
rapidity.
He gazes in pity and
Difficult to anxiety upon the lurid
Divide, phantoms of despair
] that pass in rapid re¬
view over a leaden sky bedecked only here
and there with a star of hope. He clutches
and welcomes every ray of light that is
thrown upon the horizon of the na¬
tion. Yet, he remains true to his mission
and paints in bold relief the dark side of tne
picture, arching it with the glorious law of
promise, based upon love and righteous
conduct. In these alone is the hope of the
nation to be found. The splendid past of
the nation is fading from view, merging
into a memory, crumbling into chaos and
confusion. "And as decay has no climax
and ruin no rhythm so we may understand
why it is impossible to divide with any
certainty Hosea's record of Israel's fall."
