LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF HOSEA.
for all time. The dark, thick night of Is¬
rael will be followed by a fair morn of sun¬
shine and gladsome joy. He now gathers
up all of his reserve force and prophetic
fire, and makes one last appeal to the na¬
tion's conscience. Hope lingers still; mercy
has not flown; even now the nation may
repent and turn to God. The trial of argu¬
ment is to him quite familiar now; but with
redoubled earnestness he presses upon the
people the claims of Jehovah. But, alas!
they will not turn: all hope is in vain: Eph-
raim is wedded to his idols: like a stupid
runaway ass he goes to Assyria. So the
faithful prophet to an obstinate people pro¬
nounces upon them a doom more awful and
blighting than was ever before announced.
But doom is never final with him. Judg¬
ment is never the last word of Jehovah to
his people. Out of discipline and judg¬
ment will come joy and gladness. Out of
the grave of death will spring a renewed
life.
"I will ransom them from the power of the
grave;
I will redeem them from death:
O death, I will be thy plagues
0 grave, I will be thy destruction
