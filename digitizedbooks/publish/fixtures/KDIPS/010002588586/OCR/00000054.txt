LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF HOSEA.
It is a characteristic of sacred prophecy
that while it may refer primarily to some
moral condition or immediate event in the
life of the tribe or nation, it also refers to
an event farther away, an event of which
the former is the shadow, or type. Almost
all of the Messianic prophecies can be in¬
terpreted in this way. Where deliverance
is predicted it may refer to a deliverance
close at hand; but its complete consumma¬
tion is to be found in the Christ that is to
come. So in this case, God promises to
ransom them from the grave upon certain
conditions, upon their repentance and re¬
turn to Him. They failed to repent, failed
to meet the. conditions, hence the deliver¬
ance would have to come at a more dis¬
tant date and in some other way. So while
Ch. xiv. refers primarily to a conditional
immediate redemption, ultimately it refers
to the restoration after tha captivity.

rael. Ignorance was the cause of their sin.
