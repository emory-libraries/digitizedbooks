LIFE AND PROPHECIES OF HOSEA.
Israel. The analogy is very striking and
complete. Hosea, whose name means Sav¬
ior, typifies Jehovah in His grief over His
spouse. Gomer in her domestic infidelity
typifies the nation, Ephraim in her national
idolatry. Gomer's paramour represents
the idol gods which Israel had followed,
and the children represent the result of the
nation's sin, a weak and uiaholy genera¬
tion with the displeasure of Jehovah upon
them. Gomer was redeemed with a price.
God offered His love, yea, His Son as the
price of Israel's redemption. But before
Israel's redemption she must be scattered,
made a slave, and left without a king. So
the parallel runs, "I bought her to me for
fifteen pieces of silver. * * * * * And
I said unto her, Thou shalt abide alone many
days, thou shalt not play the harlot, and
thou shalt not be for any man, and I shall
not be for thee. For the children of Israel
shall abide many days without a king, and
without a prince and without a sacrifice, and
and without a teraphim. Afterward shall
the children of Israel return and seek the
Lord their God, and David their king; and
shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the
latter days."
Thus the first section of this strange book
comes to a close.
