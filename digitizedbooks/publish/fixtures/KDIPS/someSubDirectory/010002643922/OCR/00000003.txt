PREFACE
Yielding to the solicitation of many persons,
strangers as well as acquaintances and friends, I am
offering the following paper to the public.
It is the result of serious labor and care and sent
forth in the hope that it may furnish encouragement
to the earnest women into whose hands it may fall.
The generous reader is asked to give to this
humble effort the few moments attention wrhich its
perusal will entail.
