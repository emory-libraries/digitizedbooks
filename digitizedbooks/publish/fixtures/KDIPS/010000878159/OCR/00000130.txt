AFRICAN METHODISM.
St. John Chapel Church, Montgomery, Ala.—This
church was organized in the home of Brother Thorp
Williams by Richard B. Bailey. It was 011 the south
side of Market St., now known as Dexter Ave. When
organized there were only five or six members; for
some time they worshipped in that place. In proc¬
ess of time they removed to North Court Street, near
the Alabama River and worshipped in an old work¬
shop owned by Mr. Frazier. It was in a measure a
public building, and they remained there until able to
purchase the beautiful lot on the north side of Madison
Ave., between Jackson and Ripley Streets. They have
a substantial and commodious building, with a splen¬
did auditorium and basement. It has been greatly
improved and beautified by the Rev. W. G. Alexan¬
der, D. D., and its membership numbers about 1,000.
It has some of the best class leaders in the Connec¬
tion, but we will only mention one. Mitchell Thomas,
leader of Class No. 7, who regularly, on. an' average,
every Monday night, reports $2.00 for pastor's sup¬
port. The parsonage, No. 807 Madison- Ave., is a
splendid six-room building with a basement, and nicely
furnished. The plans were drawn for reconstruction
by that scholarly Christian gentleman, Rev. J. Q. John¬
son, D. D., in 1898; he succeeded in making it beautiful
as well as comfortable.
The writer pastored St. John, 1900, with a most glo¬
rious success every way. More than 200 members
were added. Rev. W. B. Johnson, A. M., is her present
distinguished pastor.
Ensley—Taylor's Chapel, Rev. E. L,. Duncan, pas¬
tor. Elder Duncan has never failed as a worker.
