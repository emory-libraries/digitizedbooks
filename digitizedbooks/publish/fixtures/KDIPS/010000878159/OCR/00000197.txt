Willis Nazerv, William Fisher Dickerson, Richard
Harvey Cain, James Alexander Shorter, Randolph
Richard Disney and Jabez Pitt Campbell.
On the 15th day of February, 1891, death took
Mansfield Edward Bryant. He has gone.
"Great God! On what a slender thread
Hang everlasting things!
The eternal state of all the dead,
Upon life's feeble strings."
He was a Master of Arts and a Doctor of Divinity.
He was a cultured Christian gentleman, a church dis¬
ciplinarian, theologian and missionary. His scholar¬
ship no one would dare to question. He had"a strong
volition. He believed in bending the people to the law,
and not the lawr to the people. He was a great man
and "made others great by being great' himself."
After having served his church as pastor, as presid¬
ing elder, and after having published circular papers
in the interest of "liberty, justice and equity," in the
judgment of the law-maker of the church, the great
General Conference of^ 1888, in Indianapolis, Ind., he
was made editor of The Southern Christian Recorder,
a paper designed to supplement the work of our great
church organ, especiallv in the South. In this, as in
oilier duties assigned him, he was " more than the place
lie occupied."
A man who had struggled with the pfoblems of life
and had plodded his wav up the ladder of success and
fame for near thirty-nine years; deprived of the coun¬
sel and advice of a father, the only child and support
of a mother, born in or near Opelika, Ala., in 1852.
He has gone to his reward—heaven.
