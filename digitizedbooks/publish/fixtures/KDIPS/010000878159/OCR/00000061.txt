The services were concluded after the obituaries of
Rev. Joseph Leonard and Sister Rebecca Chapman,
wife of Rev. Robt. Chapman, were read.
Bros. G. W\ Watson, W. H. Manning, W. H. Mixon
and General Dancy were received in full connection.
The Conference closed with four districts—Selma,
Florence, Prattville and Huntsville. Rev. Lazarus
Gardner, who was transferred from the Louisiana
Conference was appointed Presiding Elder of the
Prattville District, and Rev. J. Frazier was appointed
Presiding Elder of the Florence District. Upon these
announcements, Rev. M. E. Bryant arose in the Con¬
ference and objected to the Presiding Elder of the
Florence District, stating as his reason, the inability of
Rev. Jesse Frazier from an intellectual standpoint,
and offered his resignation as pastor of the Florence
station. Thereupon Bishop Wayman changed P. E.
Frazier to the Tuscumbia Station and appointed the
Rev. Ferdinand H. Smith, Presiding Elder of the Flor¬
ence District. Because of some business irregularities
Rev. Smith was removed as Presiding Elder of the
District in the interval of the Conference, and the Rev.
M. Edward Bryant served as Presiding Elder of the
District, filling- the unexpired time and serving as
pastor of the Florence station also. The Rev. J. M.
Goodloe was appointed Presiding Elder of the Hunts¬
ville District,
