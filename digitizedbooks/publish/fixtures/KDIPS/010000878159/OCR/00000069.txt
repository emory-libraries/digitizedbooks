in Eufaula, Ala. Our Bishop and Conference sent the
following fraternal message to them:
''To the Bishop and Members of the Alabama Confer'
ence of the M. B. Church South:
"Brethren:—We, the members of the Alabama Con¬
ference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church,
having learned that your Conference is now in session
in Eufaula, Ala., would respectfully beg leave to ex¬
tend you our Christian greeting. The African M. E.
Church as you are aware was organized in 1816.
Then she was poor and small; now she has 41 Annual
Conferences, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-
two itinerant ministers, nine thousand seven hundred
and sixty local preachers, three hundred and ninety-
one thousand members, nine bishops, two universities,
one located at Xenia, Ohio, and the other at Colum¬
bia, S. C., one college at Waco, Tex., and a publishing
department at Philadelphia, Pa. At the close of the
late war, our church entered the Southern states with a
view of hunting up our race, preaching the gospel to
them, and trying to elevate them morally, socially, re¬
ligiously and educationally. So far, by the assistance
of the Father of us all, we have succeeded until our
church dots almost every valley and hill from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Potomac River. We ask that
we may have your Christian love, aid and sympathy in
the furtherance of our work. We are yours as members
of the great Methodist family,
A. W. Wayman, Presiding Bishop.
I. N. Fitzpatrick.
