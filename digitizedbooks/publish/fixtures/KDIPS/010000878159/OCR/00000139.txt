CHAPTER XVI.
REV. T. W. COFFEE, D. D.,
The subject of this sketch was born in Lauderdale
County, Alabama, July 4th, 1853, and eleven years of
his life was spent as a slave. When about eight years
old he was taken from his mother to wait on his mis¬
tress, and many cruelties were inflicted on him for
nearly four years.
He had a horror of slavery, and ran off and went to
the Union army before he was ten years old, but his
master plead with the officers and on account of his
age, his master was allowed to take liim back home on a
promise that he would treat him kindly—which prom¬
ise he is said to have kept for several months'—but when
the Yankees were gone and far away the Doctor says he
gave him a severe whipping and made him promise
never to run away with Yankees again.
This and cruel treatment from his mistress made him
the more determined to make another attempt to free
himself. One day his mistress threatened him with a
severe whipping and s'et the time; meanwhile he got the
baby to sleep and was sent for a brush to k^ep the flies
off of him. He went but never returned. He became
an orphan when thirteen or fourteen years of age and
was left surrounded with very unfavorable circum¬
stances in every way.
