On July 25, 1868, in Selma, Ala., the first annual

and Rev. R. B. Bailey were the first secretaries. At
that time we had 6 churches and 31 missions, now we
have — churches and — missions ; at that time we had
5,617 members, and now we have 57,000; cur churches
were valued at $5,350, now the value is $340,000.
Churches wTere then located at Selma, Eufaula, Ca-
haba, Greensborough, Florence and Opelika. At this
Conference we had five traveling Elders (now we have

three of these Elders and nine deacons were trans¬
ferred from the Georgia Conference to Alabama., and
two Elders and one deacon from the Louisiana Confer¬
ence. Selma was the histoiical center of Alabama's Af¬
rican Methodism. From her went out the four Pre¬
