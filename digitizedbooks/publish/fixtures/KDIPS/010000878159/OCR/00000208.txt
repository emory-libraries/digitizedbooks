"What man is he that livcth, and shall not see death."
—Ps. 89 .-48.
Death is as old as creation. There are twelve
million, six hundred and ninety thousand, one hun"
dred and fifty two (12,690,152) families to-day in the
United States. The Creator has tied the millions of
the globe into one bundle. He takes out a blade in the
morning" and feeds our Mother Earth. He takes a
hank at noon, and hanks1 at night for the grave an J
eternity. Death unties the heartstrings of the follow¬
ers of Confucius; makes his way among- the Mo¬
hammedans, chills the blood of the Pagans and those
wrapped in Judaism.
Yes, he comes to all. To some without a moment's
warning; yet they must surrender. • He makes the
feathered tribes fold their wings, the cattle lie down
and rise no- more, the fishes in the water to give up,
