CHAPTER IV.
The Second Annual Conference of the A. M. E.
Church met in our Mis'sion Church in Montgomery,
February 20th, 1869, Rt. Rev. John M. Brown, Pre¬
siding Bishop. Our work in the State was then in its
infancy, as is shown that when the Conference was or¬
ganized, by the election of Rev. Rev. Jacob F. Crozier,
Secretary and Rev. J. Woolwin, Assistant Secretary,
and the roll was called, only twenty preachers, includ¬
ing all classes, reported. How. different is the statistical
report of to-day. The reader can make the contrast.
This was the blank used in those days :
