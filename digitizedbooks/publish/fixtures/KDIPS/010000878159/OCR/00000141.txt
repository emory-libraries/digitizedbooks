After which he opened the doors of the church, and
one hundred and forty-five returned, and immediately a
revival broke out, and one hundred and sixteen were
added to the church, and there has been a strong church
at Centreville up to this day.
In 1881 he was ordained an elder with six others by
Bishop Wayman in the Southern M. E. Church at
Greensboro, and sent to the pastorate at Montevallo. In
March of the same year he was united in marriage to
Miss Carrie R. McGowan, of Florence, Ala.
He was next sent to Huntsville, and the next year to
Selma, being the leading charge in the State, but at
this time was much divided, and it was here that he dis¬
tinguished himelf as a pastor and preacher, uniting the
factions, and broke the Dollar Money record of the
State, raising $160, the highest amount previous being
$100.50.
His next appointment was at Birmingham, where he
built a two-story brick church, known as St. John.
He next pastored Bethel at Mobile, St. Luke at Eu-
faula, and at Tuscumbia, from which chaige he was
made P. E. by Bishop Gaines, of the Florence District,
and as P. E. served for eight years, Florence two, Bir¬
mingham three and Montgomery District three years.
Whether as pastor or P. E., he sustains the record of
reporting an increase over his predecessor from his first
charge to his last annual report.
Since his return to the pastorate he has served at Eu-
fala, where he finished one of the prettiest and mosi
comfortable parsonages in the Alabama Conference.
