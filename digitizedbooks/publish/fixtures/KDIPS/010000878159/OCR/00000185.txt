Who can understand the way of life and the way of
death? Man can come as near stopping the sun dial
or abandoning creation or measuring the waters of the
earth as he can to tell the ways of life and the ways of
death. There is no uncertainty connected with death.
There is no wTay to compromise the t>vo. Eight times
in the fifth (5) chapter of creation, or Genesis, we are
told of the deaths of patriarchs. The days of Adam were
930 years. "And he died." Seth's days were 912 years.
"And he died." The days of Enos were 905 years.
"And he died." The days of Canaan were 910 years.
"And he died." All the days of Mahaleel were 895
years. "And he died." Jared lived 962 years. "And
he died." Lamech's years were 777. "And he died."
The last one I will name in this catalogue of death is
Methuselah; all of his years were 969. "And he died."
Death passes upon all men; it takes the drunkard out
of the gutter; the beggar out of the street; the humble
man out of his hut, and the king out of tbe palace.
Death has his fan in his hand; he is fanning out the
lights' of the Goulds, Vanderbilts and Rothschilds. It
