1878, Rt. Rev. Jabez Pitt Campbell, D. D., LL. D.,
presiding". The religious' exercises were conducted by
him. Seng, "And are we yet alive, And see each other's
face?" Scripture lesson Psalm 61:4. This had been
a trying year caused by the great scourge, "yellow
fever." In the Bishop's fervent prayer he than'ked
God for his providential care in bringing so many of
the brethren from their various fields of labor to an¬
other annual conference. Although many of our fel¬
low laboring ministers have fallen victims to the great
scourge, "yellow fever," which swept over the coun¬
try—the beautiful Southland—yet, we should praise
God that through the atoning blood of Calvary they
ft 11 with their harness on, while dashing into the very
hottest scenes of the conflict, trying every possible way
to relieve the suffering- ones and to point them to
the Brazen Serpent, which was raised up to heal the
whole world. He felt thankful that while thousands
had fled from their field of labor because of the bold¬
ness and insatiable des'iie of the man upon the pale
horse, our Father had given sufficient grace and faith
to thousands of all sects and denominations to stay
where duty calls and submit themselves, body and
soul, to the care of an Omniscient and Omnipresent
God, and that among this band of heroes and heroines
for the cause of God and humanity, among these im¬
itators of Christ and the apostles, were found ministers,
brothers and sisters of an oppressed race and struggling
church, who were counted worthy and given grace for
their day and time.
After the prayer, the Bishop made some very im¬
pressive observations along the line above mentioned.
