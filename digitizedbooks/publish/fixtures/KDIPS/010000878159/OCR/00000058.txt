the following report was adopted:
To the Bishop and Conference:
We, your Committee appointed to draft resolutions
on the death of President Jas. A. Garfield, respectful¬
ly submit our report:
Hear the deep-toned knell from far and near.
It calls the nation to the chieftain bier;
With tear-dimmed eye the nation see,
Attesting their grief over the sad decree.
Thus o'er the land the millions weep
For him who lies in death's low sleep,
And with the nations in sadness we bend,
And weep o'er the martyr—the people's friend.
