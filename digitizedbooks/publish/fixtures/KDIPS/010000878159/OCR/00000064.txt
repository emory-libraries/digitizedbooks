Organization was effected by the election of Rev.
Dr. George W. Bryant, Secretary; Rev. A. N. Jack¬
son, statistical secretary. The "Wayman Cyclopedia
of African Methodism" was bought by the brethren

viso that the latter be not ordained till the adjustment

text: St. Luke 5th chapter, 4th verse, "Launch out into
the deep."'
