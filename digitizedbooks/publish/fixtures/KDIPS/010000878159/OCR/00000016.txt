PREFATORY NOTES.
fathers dated things from the "day of the show," "the
freshets," "when the stars fell," and "when ihey moved
from this plantation to the other." To-day our sons' and
daughters call for historical references.
In presenting, this volume we beg the charitableness
of our readers if any omission should occur, knowing
it is not our purpose to make it an abstract book.
If in the school room or church this should serve to
inspire young men and women to write books', thereby
accomplishing something, I shall feel amply remuner¬

or anywise disabled by affliction, if his mind is1 pure, he
may be "shut in" but not excused. Jeremiah was in

wrote messages and had them read. When St. Paul
was in prison, he continued to work for.the Master;
Bunyan wrote the "Pilgrim's Progress," while impris¬

while behind the iron bars; so there is no excuse for
those who can with voice and pen accomplish some¬
thing for God and humanity.

outlines' of the Third Annual Conference and now pre¬
paring the boundaries of the fourth, and fully believing
the interest my church will take in helping me to scatter
the contents of this volume, and praying the benedic¬
tions of the Holy Triune to guide my thoughts, words
and pen while thus recording the s'ame, and believing
the facts will help to fertilize the roots of the stem) of
