tion, trie iron-headed oppressor, the evil-doers, all pro¬
fane persons, as well as the good, are there waiting
for their eternal sentence. Eternal love arranged for
the judgment, eternal truth said it would be; and eter¬
nal justice—equity—will preside. The malignant de¬
mons will spend their eternity away from; the presence
of our Father, in woe, misery and remorse—without
understanding the mystery thereof. "Behold, and holy
is he that hath part in the first resurrection." O!
Church of the living God, Grief-stricken Church, af
flicted, lamenting the death of your prelate, editor and
ministers! Endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ.
You will see your bishops again ; you will see your
ministers again; you will see our class leaders again;
you will see the members of your church and the mem¬
bers of your families again. Where? Where? Where
will you see them? The answer comes, "At the judg¬
ment seat of Christ. Christians, be faithful. Work!
Watch! JJTait! And you will spend eternity with God.
"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;
and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
crying; neither shall there be any more pain; for the
former things are passed away." Eet these words
convince you :
"God moves in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform;
He plants his footsteps in the sea
And rides upon the storm.
Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan his work in vain;
God is his own interpreter,
And he will make it plain."
