AFRICAN METHODISM. 199
charity were not spasmodic efforts like the rushing of
the great Niagara, which is here all turbulent with roar¬

Christian heroes, with a manly learning, honoring the
school which moulded his scholarship, the Alabama

power to drive the quill into the mind of nations. The
voice of M. E. Bryant, which was both polished and
eloquent, and which was loudly sounded forth on the
General Conference floors of 1888, is hushed! It will
be heard no more until the day, when at the sound of
the trumpet and the shout of the archangel, the earth
and sea shall give up their dead. Such was the char¬
acter of this noble man, his worth, valor and fortitude,
that his untimely death elicited the sympathetic vibra¬
tions of the hearts' of more races than one, for a true,
noble and angelic wife, loving daughter and faithful
sons.
Truly a gallant knight in the chivalry of civilization,
Christianity, evangelization, has fallen. Reluctantly
and with a feeling of sadness, we gave him back to
Mother Earth. On the 17th of February, 1891, in the
Live Oak Cemetery, at Selma, Ala., we returned his
dust to its native clay, and his1 soul was wafted, wafted,
wafted to its immortal home, to join the disembodied
saints in Glory.
