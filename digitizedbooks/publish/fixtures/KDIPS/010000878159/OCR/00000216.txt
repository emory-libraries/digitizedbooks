the life cords of Bishop D. A. Payne, A. W. Waymanr
T. M. D. Ward, H. M. Turner, W. J. Gaines, B. W.
Arnett B. T. Tanner, A. Grant, B. F. Lee, M. B. Sal-
ters and J A. Handy. Upon whom will their mantles
fall ? Oh, I thank God for the space of earth that this
church is upon, for the name that it bears of our honÂ¬
ored dead. When it was established, Bishop Brown
was in his bloom. Here your sons and daughters
have married. It was .around this altar where they
found our blessed Redeemer. The funerals of your
mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, have been
preached, eulogistic services have been held and heavy
burd'ens made light within these walls. They are now
with our bishop in glory. "All now rest."
Bishop Brown had unbounded love for the poor and
needy. He preferred to suffer wrong rather than do
wrong, to suffer affliction rather than afflict, to suffer
oppression rather than oppress. "Precious in the sight
of the Lord is the death of his saints." Then go on,
thou art precious in God's sight, precious in the sight
of his Son ! Precious in the sight of the Holy Ghost!!
Precious in the sight of heaven is the death of His
saints!!!
