IN ALABAMA.

James A. Garfield, the 20th President of the United
States was born in Orange Township, Cuyahoga CounÂ¬
ty, Ohio, Nov. 19th, 1831, and died at Elberon, N. J.,
Sept. 19th, 1881; aged, 49 years and 10 months. No
man has ever touched the cord that binds the great
American nation as General Garfield did, but he has
gone. Pure, noble and upright, his influence will net
soon pass away, nor his example fade from sight.
His life has' shown how a man may be good and
great, and walk in the highest circles, and yet be the
friend of the poor and lowly; and how he may be the
guardian of a great nation, and of a happy family.
From lowly paths he arose by his own power until huÂ¬
man greatness stood uncovered in his presence, and
at the very pinnacle of his fame he rests from his laÂ¬
bors. What an hour to die in and how cheering the
word sent back by him from the vortex of the grave
to those around him,, and to the great Christian army.
As he stood at his post, he felt the stroke, and as he
went down, said, "God's will be done, I am ready if
my time has come."
Brethren, as Christian ministers, let us renew our alÂ¬
legiance to God and to the 23rd Article of our' Faith.
Let this thought ever be in our minds, that we
loved him while living. We inherit his honor and will
cherish his' memory while living as a noble chieftain.
Let his example inspire us to do right at all hazards,
and be true to our trust, as he was to his. Let his life
be to us a beacon light, illuminating our ill-starred
path, discovering to us and making possible for o>ur
