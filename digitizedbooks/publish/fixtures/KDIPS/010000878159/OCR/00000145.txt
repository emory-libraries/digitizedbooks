AFRICAN METHODISM. 143
Alabama. Conference the same year in December, under
Bishop W. J. Gaines, D. D. He received his first ap¬
pointment from Bishop A. Grant, December, 1892, at
Eufaula, Ala. His first charge as pastor was Suspen¬
sion Mission, where he secured a lot and built a nice
frame church. In 1893, he was appointed to Bethel and
Powell Missions near Hurtsboro, Russell County, Ala¬
bama. There he remodeled the church and bought a
bell and made the best report ever brought from that
place up to that time. He was ordained deacon by
Bishop A. Grant, in 1893, at Troy, Ala., and was given
the Troy Circuit, where he was pastor two years. He
added sixty members to the church and built two
- churches. During the years of '97 and '98, he was pas¬
tor of the Clopton Circuit. At this place he found the
church unfinished and without a parsonage; he com¬
pleted the church, built a cozy three-room parsonag'e
and added one hundred and twenty-five members to the
church, and made a stirring report at the Conference.
In December, 1899, was appointed to Midway Cir¬
cuit. He remodeled the church and built a new mod¬
ern belfry and steeple to Great Hope A. M. E. Church,
and added thirty-six members to the Circuit. Sept.
3rd of the same year, he was ordained elder by Bishop
H. M. Turner at Inverness, Ala. He was appointed
to Troy Station to carry out the unexpired term of
Rev. H. C. Calhoun. From Troy Station he was' sent
to his present charge—Gaines Chapel Station, Dothan,
Ala. Here again he found an indebted church. Tro¬
jan, who had fought so many financial battles, renewed
his energy and proved himself equal to the emergency.
