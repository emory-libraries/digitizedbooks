We have the division of time and of seasons: "A
time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and
& time to pluck up that which is planted; a time to kill,
and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to
build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time
to mourn, and a time to dance; a time to1 cast away
-stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to
embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; a
time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a
time to cast away; a time to rend, and a time to sew;
.a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; a time to
.love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of
peace."

the nations have adjusted their national festivities, as
well as paternal and maternal collations to the seasons.
But the rider upon his pale horse has made no agree¬
