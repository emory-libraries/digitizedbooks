similar committee of members of the Alabama Confer¬
ence of the African M. E. Church, with the view of
dividing the churches of our denomination in the State
of Alabama into three annual conferences, to be
known as the North Alabama Conference, the Central
Alabama Conference and the South Alabama Confer¬
ence. This joint committee shall meet at such time
and place as shall be convenient to them. If the Bish¬
op is absent they shall elect one of their number as
chairman, and then proceed to consider the advisablity
of such division. They shall examine statistics and
other available information, so as to give each of the
said proposed conferences, as near as possible, an equal
division of our work. This committee shall meet dur¬
ing the interval immediately succeeding the adjourn¬
ment of the sessions of the North Alabama and the
Alabama Conferences of 1890, and shall report to the
annual sessions of each of these conferences. The
said conferences shall, at the sessions indicated, con¬
sider the said report, either adopting or rejecting it, or
amending such report. In the event of the adop¬
tion of said report by said conferences, each confer¬
ence shall join in a petition to the next session of the
General Conference of the African Methodist Episco¬
pal Church for the division agreed upon bv the Ala¬
bama conferences. In the event of the adoption of
this resolution, the Bishop is hereby requested to call
the said joint convention together for the purpose of
organization, provided he consult by mail or otherwise
write the members of the committee as to time and
place.
