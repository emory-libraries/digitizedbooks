AFRICAN METHODISM
Elder Brooks presented his transfer ticket from the
Savannah, Ga., Conference, also his certificate of holy
orders. The documents showed Elder Brooks in high
standing in the M. E. Church. They were signed by
Bishops Foster and Warren. The petition brought
by him is as follows:
Venerable Bishop Pwyne and Members of the Con¬
ference:
I am here from the Central Alabama Conference of
the M. E. Church to* unite with your distinguished
body. My resignation from the Methodist Episcopal
Church did not originate from any mistreatment to me
whatever. I simply withdrew from said church to
gratify a long felt desire to be with my colored breth¬
ren, although I was pleasantly treated by my white
brethren while I remained with them; yet, I saw such
explicit mark of distinction between races on account of
previous conditions and color as caused me to feel that
the saying that we went upon equality was a farce;
therefore, I desire to be in a church in which I could
feel that said church recognized every man as having
in his soul the sign of human equality. Having had
an eye on your church for six years, I have adequate
reason to believe that it fully recognizes that fact, so I
come to you seeking shelter believing that I can be
more serviceable to God and to humanity among you.
If consistent with you to receive me, I will joyfully lay
hold and share with you the responsibility of the Chris¬
tian ministry.
Robt. D. Brooks.
