AFRICAN METHODISM
"Leaves have their time to fall,
And flowers to wither at the Northwind's breath,
And stars to set; but all—
Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death."
Here we are unacquainted; we cannot always recall
dates, places and names; memory fades, but the King
knows where his' subjects are; he is with them at home,
and when they migrate he is still their comlpanion.
This King moved about in Paradise. He has been
moving ever since.
To-night he is in the sweet fields and fertile plains
of the East, making the keepers of the house tremble.
He is moving about with the balmy breezes of the
South, making the strong men bow themselves. Dash
through the golden gates of the West, and you will
meet the king there making the grinders cease. Stand
at the telegraph and talk with those in the Elbo Moun¬
tains of the North, and they will ans'wer. The silver
cord has been loosed, the golden bowl has been
smashed, the pitcher has been broken at the fountain
and the wheel has stood still at the cistern. "What
man is he that liveth and shall not see death?" Oh,
what a question.
Death passes upon all men. Oh what an ans'wer!
Your steps may become uneven, your breath may be¬
come short. Your ivory rows may lose hold on nature.
Yet, yet you will see death. He stoops down and lifts
up the life out of the drunkard in the gutter; changes
the home of the beggar in the street; he takes the in¬
dignant man out of his' hut and dismounts the king
that sits on his throne. Man lies down at night with
his millions, wakes up a beggar; he closes his eyes in
time and wakes up in eternity.
