to do it. Historical facts, crudely presented, will give
a man a standing with posterity that will tower above
polished diction and exalted bearing, when no notation

We predict a large sale for this book, for every
young minister who expects to be anything, will desire
to supply himself with the knowledge of the work of
the fathers. And the laity who value their church, will
desire to read what it cost to establish the church of
their choice. Young men of the future will light their
torches at the fires kindled by Dr. Mixon, and drawing
inspiration from his example, will not only record the
deeds of this and future generations, but will write
systems of Theology, and possibly annotations upon
the word of God, as revealed in the Bible, with such
force and clearness' as will dissipate the mist and gloom
that now shades many questions, and leaves them in
doubt.
Trusting that the labors and sacrifices of the intelli¬
gent and industrious author may be crowned with suc¬
cess, and prove a blessing to the church, we take great
pleasure in introducing it to the millions.
