190 AFRICAN METHODISM.
Campbell is in the saint's everlasting rest. He is at
home. All about in Christendom his voice is still
heard, saying, "Preach the Word." I caught the
sound; you catch it and let it go to every mystery-
hunting servant. Let it get in the heart, in the mouth
and upon the tongue. Let the spark of grace go. Let
the sound of vibration go to every nation, kindred- and
and tribe, saying, "Preach the Word! Preach the
Word!! Preach the Word!!! And die with your
gword in your hand.
