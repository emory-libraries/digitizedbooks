John Wesley was a hero; Richard Allen was a hero;
Henry M. Turner is a hero; the old organizers, who-

gospel and organize churches, were heroes. There-

points, no steamboats entering the sections, yet the
gospel had to go, and Mr. Wesley said, "The world is-
my parish." The commission of the Son of God is:
"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things what¬
soever I have coinnnunded you: and, lo, I am with you
alzvay, even unto the end of the world. Amen."
