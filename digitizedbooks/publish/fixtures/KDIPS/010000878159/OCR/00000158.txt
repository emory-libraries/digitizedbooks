In 1885, Rev. John Harmon founded the Odd Fel¬
lows Journal as an independent enterprise, which
paper he published regularly for six years, and the
concensus of opinion was that it was the best paper
that the Order had ever had. He has delivered ora¬
tions to the Odd Fellows at Montgomery, Selma, Mo¬
bile, Birmingham, Huntsville, Eufaula, Troy, Annis-
ton, Ala.; Atlanta, Savannah, Americus, Albany,
Rome, Macon, Ga.; St. Louis, Mo.; Philadelphia, Pa.,
and Chattanooga, Tenn.
In politics he stood among the leaders in the state of
Alabama. He has been elected many times delegate to
the county, district and state conventions, and was elect¬
ed delegate to the Republican national convention at St.
Louis, Mo., June 1896, from the third congressional
district of iVlabama, and he has spoken from the same
platform with such statesman as George P. Harrison,
H. D. Clayton, of Alabama, and Judge George Tur¬
ner, the present United States Senator from the state
of Washington. This eminent divine canvassed hia
state for Harrison and McKinley. He joined the
church in childhood and has since been an active
worker in Sunday school and church work. At fif¬
teen years of age he was superintendent of the New
Hope A. M. E. Sunday School at Smithville, Ga., and
for three years he was superintendent of St. John's A.
M. E. Sunday School at Montgomery, Ala., and was
also treasurer of trustees and stewards' boards of said
church. He has the credit of giving the church new
life which gave it its present progressive condition.
