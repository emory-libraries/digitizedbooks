CHAPTER III.
ORGANIZATION OF A. M. E. CHURCH IN ALABAMA.
African Methodism sprang up in the city of Mobile
as far back as 1820, but was crushed by slavery. In
1864, Rev. J. P. Campbell, who was' afterward one of
the Church, and Rev. M. M. Clark, visited that city,
and preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the name
of the African M. E". Church, In 1867, Rt. Rev. A.
W. Wayman, Presiding- Bishop of Georgia, appointed
missionaries to Alabama. As far as we have been able
to gather information here and there, the organization
was fully started in 1867 and 1868.
The early pioneers of this work were Revs. Lazarus
Gardner, Cain Rogers, (but Cain Rogers is now in the
M. E. Church), Peter Lipscomb, Harry Stubbs, R. B.
Bailey, F. H. Smith, G. B. Taylor, Louis Hillary, and
Jacob F. Crozier.
The General Conference sitting in Washington, D.
C., May, 1868, elected the Rev. Jas. A. Shorter, Rev.
Thomas M. D. Ward and the Rev. John M. Brown
to the episcopacy, and at the same conference set apart
Alabama as the 7th Episcopal District, and appointed
the newly elected Bishop John M. Brown to preside
over the same, making him our first Bishop, who
stamped his scholarly and classical elements upon everv
thing he touched in our early pilgrimage.
