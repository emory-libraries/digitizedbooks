St. John's Montgomery, Ala., Rev. W. B. Johnson,
A. M., pastor. This is one of the leading- churches
of the State. Regardless of denominations, Elder
Johnson was the first principal of Payne School. He
has never failed in the schoolroom or pulpit.
St. Luke, Eufaula, Ala., Rev. C. G. Hatchen, pastor.
Elder Hatchen is a young man who is blessed with
great power.
Emmanuel, Mobile, Rev. H. N. Newsome, pastor.
Elder Newsome is the most successful young minister
in the State.
Rev. Moses Moreland, Bethel, Mobile. When Rev.
Moreland was appointed to this station, the people al¬
most went into rebellion because of his youthful ap¬
pearance. Rev. L. Gardner, Presiding Elder, said:
"I will go his security that he will have success." The
people sent telegrams and even a committee to Bishop
Turner in Atlanta to have him removed. They took
him on trial. What has been the result? One of the
most substantial and beautiful two story church edi¬
fices erected in the Connection by his untiring energy.
Elder Moreland has been pastor in this field five years,
and if left to the people, he could wind up his career
there.
St. Luke, Opelika, Ala., Rev. F. H. Goodman, pas¬
tor. Eor earnestness and firmness in principle, Elder
Goodman has few equals.
St. James, Avondale, Rev. C. C. .Montgomery, pas¬
tor. In the winter of 1887 he organized this station
in an old saloon building, known as the "White Ele¬
phant." Elder Montgomery is doing a glorious work
there.
