Among the different reports at this session none re¬
ceived more attention than the report on Temperance.
During the able discussion, Bishop Turner said:
"The greatest question now being agitated all over
the civilized world is the question of Temperance. In¬
temperance is the father of jail houses, chaii>
gangs and insanity. The whisky men are using the
Bible to sustain them in propagating bar-rooms.,
etc. The wine mentioned in the Bible is simply the
pure grape juice. There was no whisky or alcohol in
the world before the 13th century, or in the year 1250.'^
He further said that liquor contributed to nothing*
but bread, apples, oranges and other fruit contributed
to health, vigor and manhood.
