AFRICAN METHODISM
The sixteenth session convened in Emanuel Church,
Mobile, Ala., December 7 to 12, 1882, Bishop A. W.
Wayman, D. D., presiding. He read the 13th chapter
of 1 Cor. concerning Charity, and made remarks as
follows (which should live in the hearts and mindb
of those who heard them, and also the readers of this
historv, even to unborn generations). With a pathetic
voice, he eloquently proclaimed: "Human eloquence
does not amount to a great deal without charity. A
man may delve deep and soar high, count the stars and
speak many and various' languages, he is nothing with¬
out charity. External religion' like that of the Phari¬
sees, where the trump is sounded—in the giving of
money to the poor, clothing to the naked; but without
charity this is nothing. Oh, my brethren, charity
suffereth much and is kind. When charity hears the
winter wind howl, and sees the snow falling she won¬
ders—her heart aches—and she goes forth to hunt up
the poor and administer to their wants.
" 'Charity envieth notshe is not envious of the
popular; she knows that all have not the same ability.
She is not puffed up. She is exemplary. She letteth
her light shine; it is not necessary to put a placard on
her beauty to tell the world she is a Christian; her
works prove it. Thank God, from amid adversity
and wars and rumors of wars there are a few still left
who possess the grand virtues of charity. 'Tis evil
disposed people who think evil of others; charity hates
sin as a man of discretion would throw away deadly
poison; charity doeth not rejoice in the downfall of a
man, she rejoiceth in the truth,"
