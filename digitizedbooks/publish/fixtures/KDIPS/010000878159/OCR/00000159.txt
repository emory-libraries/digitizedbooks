Rev. Harmon organized and gave to the A. M. E.
connection the second church at Montgomery, Ala.,
which is now St. Stephens A. M. E. Church. While'
pastor at White Hall, Ala., he built the pulpit, altar,
seated the church, bought and paid for a bell for the
church, built a belfry, and in a two week's revival had
157 converts, some of whom are preachers and officers
in the church now. At Abbeville, Ala., he built and
paid for a three room parsonage; increased the mem¬
bership of the church from 61 to 149; also finished up
a church near Abbeville and paid it out of debt, and
greatly increased the membership of the same. At
Wells, Ala., he organized a church, bought land and
lumber for the edifice. At Eufaula, Ala., he pur¬
chased a bell for the church at a cost of $135, an or-
^an for $120, built a recess for choir, pulpit and altar,
wainscoated and plastered the church and also finished
up the parsonage at a total cost of $1,100, and paid all
of it except $190, with a membership of 125. He car¬
ried $101 to his conference from the same charge,
which was the largest amount ever reported from there.
In January, 1898, he was transferred to the North
Georgia Conference and assigned to the Palmetto
Circuit. A new church was added to the connection
and a $50 bell was paid for and put on the church.
The membership was increased also and the work re¬
vived. He was next appointed to Newnan, Ga.
There he paid off the indebtedness of the church; gave
new life to the church and greatly increased the mem¬
bership. At the last North Georgia Annual Confer¬
ence of the A. M. E. Church, this distinguished pulpit
orator was appointed pastor of the Thomaston station,
