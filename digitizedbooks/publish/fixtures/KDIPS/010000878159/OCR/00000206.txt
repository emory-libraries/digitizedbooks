204 AFRICAN METHODISM.
dured a servitude the most degrading, and a slavery
which was worse than death—"the sum of all vil¬
lainy!" Naught can disturb your peaceful slumber.
"O! What is death? 'Tis life's last shore,
Where vanities are vain no more!
Where all pursuits their goal obtain;
And life is all retouched again;
Where in their bright results shall rise,
Thoughts, virtue, friendships, griefs and joys."
Inspired by the life of this great man, this leader
among leaders, generations who will yet come upon
the stage of this great amphitheatre world, will grasp
the sword of liberty, equality and justice and religion,
and, Caesar-like, will never let go, but will die with this
implement of warfare in hand, fighting for the value
of dollars ! For the value of manhood! For the value
of human blood! "L,ive peaceably with all, if possible;
if not, fight! Fight! I repeat it—Fight!" Die with
your sword in hand, leaving the result with God.
