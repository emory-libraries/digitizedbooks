This year Rev. M. E. Bryant, editor of the South¬
ern Christian Recorder, had to escape from Selma,
charged with writing inflammatory editorials and not
even granted the chance to vindicate himself. Mr. E.
C. Jones and Mr. J. H. Clark were also forced to leave
their homes on account of a race conflict. The writer
offered the following resolution:
Whereas, Rev. M. E. Bryant, a faithful and true
member of this North Alabama A. M. E. Conference,
is away from home, saving his life, therefore be it
Resolved, That we rejoice with his friends in the
preservation of his life, and pray God's blessing upon
him and his dear family.
