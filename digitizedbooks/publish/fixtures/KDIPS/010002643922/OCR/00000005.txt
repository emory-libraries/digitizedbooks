vS. Maria Steward, M.D.
(Pres. Scarborough's Annual Report, June 16, 191U-)
"Dr. S. M. Steward, our Resident Physician for a number of years,
has been faithful in looking after the young people in need of medical
attention. I am very glad to commend her and her services, and to
say that to have such a woman connected with the institution, where
there is large attendance of girls, is indispensable."
